Question: What is an official trip?
Answer: According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG), an official trip is a journey undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which has been ordered or approved by the responsible superior, unless an order or approval is not applicable due to the nature of the official’s office or the nature of the official business. The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically. 

Official trips also include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work, provided that certain conditions are met (specifically, the conditions of unspecified sentences are met).

Additionally, for a judge carrying out judicial duties, the state commissioner for data protection performing their duties, or the government commissioner for the concerns of people with disabilities performing their duties, no order or approval is required for their official trips.

Finally, official trips abroad are defined as trips between the domestic territory and foreign countries, or within foreign countries, with at least one business location located abroad.

Answer: Yes, travelers will be compensated for certain extra costs, but also face some restrictions. Here's a breakdown based on the document:

* **Climate Compensation:** A climate compensation payment is now *statutorily anchored* for officially required flights, meaning there's a new cost covered.
* **Mileage & Travel Costs:** There are new regulations for travel costs and mileage allowance, implying changes to reimbursement. Increases in some compensations (like mileage allowance and travel cost reimbursement starting from residence) are being offset by savings elsewhere.
* **Extended Stays:** For longer trips, actual accommodation costs *and* a lump sum for meal expenses (for the first three months) will be reimbursed instead of a previous lump-sum compensation.
* **Cancellations:** Expenses incurred in preparation for canceled trips (not the traveler's fault) *will* be reimbursed.
* **Rental Cars/Taxis:** Costs are reimbursable if a “compelling reason” exists; otherwise, reimbursement is capped at the cost of public transport.
* **Expense Allowance:** Travelers with generally lower expenses may receive an expense allowance *instead* of per diem, accommodation allowance, and some other reimbursements.



However, there are also cost-saving measures:

* **First-Class Travel:** Eligibility for first-class train travel is restricted.
* **Per Diem:** The reduction of the per diem allowance in cases of complimentary meals is adjusted to align with tax regulations.
