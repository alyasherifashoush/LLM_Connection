chunk_54,"Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part  – 
Objective: The revision of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) is the first comprehensive 
restructuring of travel expense law since UU. The new regulations pursue the goal of reducing 
bureaucracy and meet the demand for a simplification of the application and settlement 
procedures and for straightforward rules. The previous travel expense law is outdated and 
requires updating and legal simplification to ease the conduct and administrative processing of 
official travel. Overall, the density of regulation is reduced ( instead of  paragraphs and the 
elimination of one regulation). Furthermore, regarding mobility behavior, the requirements of 
climate protection are to be considered (exemplary function of the state administration pursuant 
to §  of the Climate Protection Act)."

chunk_55,"Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part – Essential 
Content: A revision of the State Travel Expense Act resulting in a modern regulatory framework. 
The focal points are: . . . . . . New regulation for travel costs and mileage allowance. Adjustment

this regulation eliminates the taxation of parts of the per diem. The provisions for foreign travel 
are integrated into the Act and the general administrative regulations; the previous State Foreign 
Travel Expense Regulation becomes redundant and may lapse. Expenses during an extended 
stay at the business location, separation allowance: For longer official trips and secondments,

costs estimated at , euros result from the climate compensation payment for officially required

reimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) are offset by savings in other provisions 
(restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains, adjustment of the reduction of the per diem 
in the case of complimentary meals in accordance with tax regulations). Savings that cannot

chunk_64,"Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  
For paragraph : For administrative economy reasons, official travelers are to have the free 
choice of means of transport while taking ecological and economic aspects into account. In 
particular, public transport should generally be given priority on long journeys. Whether and to 
what extent this will influence the mobility behavior of the travelers can be evaluated based on

reimbursed. In the case of train journeys, with the current travel comfort, it is acceptable to use 
second class even over longer distances. The highest competent authority may permit 
exceptions for its area of responsibility. This strengthens the departments’ self- responsibility

chunk_68,"Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  For 
paragraph : The mandatory performance of a climate compensation for officially required flights 
is intended to contribute to a climate-neutral state administration. Public universities are 
recommended to do likewise."

chunk_69,"Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding 
§  With the use of one’s own motor vehicle, there were previously three different rates (G, , and  
cents/km), depending on whether the vehicle’s engine capacity was above or below G ccm, 
whether compelling reasons existed for its use, and whether the vehicle was approved for 
official travel. In addition, the vehicle had to belong to the traveler or to a person living in a 
common household (which repeatedly led to problems, especially in non-marital partnerships). 
In the future, only two rates shall apply: –  cents if there is a significant official interest in the use 
of the vehicle. This includes employees who, under the law in force until December , , fulfilled 
the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel (in particular, field 
employees), as well as other employees when carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely 
disabled employees. The previous additional allowance of  cents/km for accompanying persons 
is eliminated. –  cents/km in all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another 
vehicle (for example, bicycle, e-bike). This rate is intended to cover the ongoing operating costs. 
With this new regulation, the formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official 
travel” is eliminated, as is the previously often cumbersome examination of whether compelling 
reasons exist. Furthermore, an incentive is created to use a bicycle or e-bike for shorter official 
trips. For the entitlement to mileage allowance, it is no longer required that the traveler uses a 
vehicle they own."

chunk_70,"Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding § C For 
paragraph : This corresponds to the previous § U LRKG. Only the minimum duration justifying a 
claim to per diem is increased from exactly eight hours to more than eight hours. This 
corresponds to the tax regulation and is intended to avoid the administratively burdensome 
taxation of the per diem when the trip lasts exactly eight hours."

chunk_71,"Explanatory Memorandum  B.

previous §  LRKG. The term “relevant residence for travel expense law” has been clarified."

regulation corresponds to the previous §  LRKG."

administrative simplification."

chunk_74,"Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  
For paragraph : Since accommodation allowance can only be granted for actual overnight stays, 
the time conditions of the previous §  () LRKG are no longer necessary. The administrative 
regulation of the Ministry of Finance on the State Travel Expense Act (LRKGVwV) shall 
establish guidelines for the amount of reimbursable costs."
