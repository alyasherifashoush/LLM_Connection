1. **Per Diem Allowance**:  
   - For each full calendar day of an official trip, a per diem allowance of **€80** is granted.

   - The percentages also apply if the traveler does not avail themselves of complimentary meals without a compelling reason.

3. **Official Trips Abroad**:  
   - The per diem and accommodation allowance are granted for the country the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time.  
   - If the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem is granted for the country of the last business location abroad.

4. **Errands and Long Trips**:  
   - For official errands, there is **no entitlement** to a per diem allowance according to paragraph ().
   - For errands lasting more than eight hours, necessary documented expenses for meals are reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.
