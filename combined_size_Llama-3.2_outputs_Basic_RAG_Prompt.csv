1. **Climate Compensation Payment**: The inclusion of a climate compensation payment for official flights is intended to reduce the administrative burden on the Ministry of Finance and to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. By providing a monetary incentive for reducing carbon emissions, the government aims to achieve its climate protection objectives.

2. **Simplification of Administrative Procedures**: The revision of the travel expense law is aimed at reducing bureaucracy and making the application and settlement procedures for official travel more straightforward. The new regulations are intended to simplify the process, making it easier for public officials to conduct their work and for the government to manage its finances.

3. **Meeting the Demand for Simplification**: The updated travel policy is a response to the demand for simplification and updating of the travel expense law, which has been in place since the previous version. The new regulations are intended to ease the conduct and administrative processing of official travel, making it easier for the government to manage its resources and achieve its objectives.

4. **Reducing Bureaucracy**: The revision of the travel expense law is also aimed at reducing bureaucracy, as the previous law was seen as overly complex and time-consuming. By simplifying the regulations, the government aims to reduce the administrative burden on officials and make the process more efficient.

5. **Mobility Behavior and Climate Protection**: The inclusion of climate protection requirements is intended to promote the state administration's function as an exemplar of the function of the state administration pursuant to §  of the Climate Protection Act.

2. **Cost Concerns**: The government aims to minimize costs by reducing the number of exceptions and restrictions on travel expenses, allowing for more flexibility in choosing the most suitable means of transportation, such as using a bicycle or e-bike for shorter official trips.
3. **Ecological and Economic Aspects**: The changes are also aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of official travel and promoting more sustainable transportation options, such as using public transport or alternative modes of transportation.
4. **Reducing Administrative Effort**: By streamlining the process and eliminating unnecessary requirements, the government aims to reduce the administrative effort required for processing travel expense claims.
