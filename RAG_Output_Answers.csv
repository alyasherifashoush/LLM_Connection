Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part – Essential 
Content: A revision of the State Travel Expense Act resulting in a modern regulatory framework. 
The focal points are: . . . . . . New regulation for travel costs and mileage allowance. Adjustment 
of the reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals to align with tax regulations: 
this regulation eliminates the taxation of parts of the per diem. The provisions for foreign travel 
are integrated into the Act and the general administrative regulations; the previous State Foreign 
Travel Expense Regulation becomes redundant and may lapse. Expenses during an extended 
stay at the business location, separation allowance: For longer official trips and secondments, 
instead of the previous lump-sum compensation, the actual necessary accommodation costs 
and, for the first three months, a lump sum to compensate for additional meal expenses shall be 
reimbursed. Elimination of rarely occurring special regulations. Statutory anchoring of a climate 
compensation payment for official flights.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Scope () This Act regulates the 
reimbursement of expenses for official trips and official errands as well as for trips for the 
purpose of education or training (travel expense reimbursement) for state officials, judges in 
state service, and officials of municipalities, counties, and other bodies, institutions, and 
foundations under state supervision, as well as other officials and judges seconded to these 
employers. In addition, this Act regulates the reimbursement of expenses incurred on the

1. **Ordered or Approved Official Business:** Tasks or journeys specifically “ordered or approved by the responsible superior” (LRKG §2). This applies to both “official trips” (outside the usual place of work) and “official errands” (at the place of work or residence outside official premises). However, this requirement is waived for certain officials like judges and data protection commissioners when performing specific duties (LRKG §3).
2. **Judicial Duties/Specific Legal Roles:** Duties directly related to a judge’s role (carrying out judicial duties, attending court meetings) or the state commissioner for data protection/government commissioner for the concerns of people with disabilities performing their duties under relevant acts (LRKG §3).
3. **Training/Education (with stipulations):** Trips undertaken “for the purpose of education or training” are covered, especially those “necessary for obtaining the qualifications for a career” (LRKG §1). Reimbursement for these trips can be reduced, but the highest competent authority can waive that reduction for “special official reasons”. Partial official interest in training can also lead to reimbursement with consent.
4. **Secondary Activity (at request of authority):** Official trips undertaken for a secondary activity *at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority* are eligible for reimbursement, provided no other body is already covering the costs (LRKG §5).



Essentially, a task is legitimate if it’s connected to an official’s job, explicitly authorized, or related to required training/education, and falls within the scope of the Act as it applies to state officials, judges, and related personnel (LRKG §6).

Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part  – 
Objective: The revision of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) is the first comprehensive 
restructuring of travel expense law since UU. The new regulations pursue the goal of reducing 
bureaucracy and meet the demand for a simplification of the application and settlement 
procedures and for straightforward rules. The previous travel expense law is outdated and 
requires updating and legal simplification to ease the conduct and administrative processing of 
official travel. Overall, the density of regulation is reduced ( instead of  paragraphs and the 
elimination of one regulation). Furthermore, regarding mobility behavior, the requirements of 
climate protection are to be considered (exemplary function of the state administration pursuant 
to §  of the Climate Protection Act).

state service, and officials of municipalities, counties, and other bodies, institutions, and 
foundations under state supervision, as well as other officials and judges seconded to these 
employers. In addition, this Act regulates the reimbursement of expenses incurred on the 
occasion of a secondment (separation allowance).
Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part  – 
Objective: The revision of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) is the first comprehensive 
restructuring of travel expense law since UU. The new regulations pursue the goal of reducing 
bureaucracy and meet the demand for a simplification of the application and settlement 
procedures and for straightforward rules. The previous travel expense law is outdated and 
requires updating and legal simplification to ease the conduct and administrative processing of 
official travel. Overall, the density of regulation is reduced ( instead of  paragraphs and the 
elimination of one regulation). Furthermore, regarding mobility behavior, the requirements of 
climate protection are to be considered (exemplary function of the state administration pursuant 
to §  of the Climate Protection Act).

Content: A revision of the State Travel Expense Act resulting in a modern regulatory framework. 
The focal points are: . . . . . . New regulation for travel costs and mileage allowance. Adjustment 
of the reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals to align with tax regulations: 
this regulation eliminates the taxation of parts of the per diem. The provisions for foreign travel 
are integrated into the Act and the general administrative regulations; the previous State Foreign 
Travel Expense Regulation becomes redundant and may lapse. Expenses during an extended 
stay at the business location, separation allowance: For longer official trips and secondments, 
instead of the previous lump-sum compensation, the actual necessary accommodation costs 
and, for the first three months, a lump sum to compensate for additional meal expenses shall be 
reimbursed. Elimination of rarely occurring special regulations. Statutory anchoring of a climate 
compensation payment for official flights.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  
Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement () Official travelers are generally free to choose 
the means of transport. In choosing the means of transport, travelers must, in addition to 
economic considerations, especially take into account the requirements of climate protection. 
Travel costs will not be reimbursed if a complimentary mode of transport is available.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Accommodation Allowance () For a 
necessary overnight stay, official travelers receive a lump sum of  euros domestically and  euros 
abroad. Higher accommodation costs shall be reimbursed to the necessary extent. An 
administrative regulation shall determine up to what amount accommodation costs are 
considered necessary.
Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part – Financial Impact: Additional 
costs estimated at , euros result from the climate compensation payment for officially required 
flights. The increases in certain compensations (for example, mileage allowance, travel cost 
reimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) are offset by savings in other provisions 
(restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains, adjustment of the reduction of the per diem 
in the case of complimentary meals in accordance with tax regulations). Savings that cannot 
currently be quantified arise from the reduction in administrative effort for the preparation and 
settlement of official travel. There is no additional implementation effort.

Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part – Essential 
Content: A revision of the State Travel Expense Act resulting in a modern regulatory framework. 
The focal points are: . . . . . . New regulation for travel costs and mileage allowance. Adjustment 
of the reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals to align with tax regulations: 
this regulation eliminates the taxation of parts of the per diem. The provisions for foreign travel 
are integrated into the Act and the general administrative regulations; the previous State Foreign 
Travel Expense Regulation becomes redundant and may lapse. Expenses during an extended 
stay at the business location, separation allowance: For longer official trips and secondments, 
instead of the previous lump-sum compensation, the actual necessary accommodation costs 
and, for the first three months, a lump sum to compensate for additional meal expenses shall be 
reimbursed. Elimination of rarely occurring special regulations. Statutory anchoring of a climate 
compensation payment for official flights.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  This 
regulation is intended to set out the special cases of the previous §§ G and  LRKG. The

Reimbursement in Special Cases (regulation to § G (G) LRKG) are simplified and incorporated 
into the Act and the administrative regulation of the Ministry of Finance on the State Travel 
Expense Act. The regulation is repealed. The authorization to refrain from a reduction in the 
training area is aimed at increasing the attractiveness of training in the public service.

(LRKG) §  Mileage Allowance ) If there is a significant official interest in the use of a motor

State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Mileage Allowance () For journeys undertaken by official 
travelers using a private motor vehicle or any other vehicle not mentioned in § , a mileage 
allowance is granted. It amounts to  cents per kilometer traveled.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding 
§  With the use of one’s own motor vehicle, there were previously three different rates (G, , and  
cents/km), depending on whether the vehicle’s engine capacity was above or below G ccm, 
whether compelling reasons existed for its use, and whether the vehicle was approved for 
official travel. In addition, the vehicle had to belong to the traveler or to a person living in a 
common household (which repeatedly led to problems, especially in non-marital partnerships). 
In the future, only two rates shall apply: –  cents if there is a significant official interest in the use 
of the vehicle. This includes employees who, under the law in force until December , , fulfilled 
the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel (in particular, field 
employees), as well as other employees when carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely 
disabled employees. The previous additional allowance of  cents/km for accompanying persons 
is eliminated. –  cents/km in all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another 
vehicle (for example, bicycle, e-bike). This rate is intended to cover the ongoing operating costs. 
With this new regulation, the formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official 
travel” is eliminated, as is the previously often cumbersome examination of whether compelling 
reasons exist. Furthermore, an incentive is created to use a bicycle or e-bike for shorter official 
trips. For the entitlement to mileage allowance, it is no longer required that the traveler uses a 
vehicle they own.

Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  For paragraph : For reasons 
of administrative simplification and cost, in principle only the costs of second class shall be 
reimbursed. In the case of train journeys, with the current travel comfort, it is acceptable to use 
second class even over longer distances. The highest competent authority may permit 
exceptions for its area of responsibility. This strengthens the departments’ self- responsibility 
and enables flexible, needs-based handling. No specific travel time or distance is stipulated. For 
air travel, the previous differentiation according to salary groups as regulated in the State 
Foreign Travel Expense Regulation is abolished.

Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part  – 
Objective: The revision of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) is the first comprehensive 
restructuring of travel expense law since UU. The new regulations pursue the goal of reducing 
bureaucracy and meet the demand for a simplification of the application and settlement 
procedures and for straightforward rules. The previous travel expense law is outdated and 
requires updating and legal simplification to ease the conduct and administrative processing of 
official travel. Overall, the density of regulation is reduced ( instead of  paragraphs and the 
elimination of one regulation). Furthermore, regarding mobility behavior, the requirements of 
climate protection are to be considered (exemplary function of the state administration pursuant 
to §  of the Climate Protection Act).

Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  
For paragraph : For administrative economy reasons, official travelers are to have the free 
choice of means of transport while taking ecological and economic aspects into account. In 
particular, public transport should generally be given priority on long journeys. Whether and to 
what extent this will influence the mobility behavior of the travelers can be evaluated based on 
the corresponding data from the CO₂ balance of the state administration, which is compiled 
every three years. Otherwise, the regulations essentially correspond to the previous §  LRKG.

claim to per diem is increased from exactly eight hours to more than eight hours. This 
corresponds to the tax regulation and is intended to avoid the administratively burdensome 
taxation of the per diem when the trip lasts exactly eight hours.
State Travel 
Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance () The duration of the official trip is determined 
from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the

case of several residences or accommodations, the one nearest to the official premises shall be 
decisive.

diem is granted until the end of the day of arrival, if from the following day onward a separation 
allowance for staying away is received; in addition, an accommodation allowance (§ ) is 
granted.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance () For each full calendar 
day of an official trip, a per diem allowance of  euros is granted to compensate for additional

departure and the day of return of a multi-day trip, the per diem allowance shall be: . . G euros

per diem shall be granted for the country of the last business location abroad.
State Travel 
Expense Act (LRKG) §  Official Trips Abroad () If the stay at the same foreign business location 
(excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than  days, the foreign per diem according to 
paragraph  shall be reduced by  percent from the th day onward. The highest competent 
authority or its authorized subordinate authority may, in justified cases, waive the reduction. 
Instead of the lump sum accommodation allowance, from the th day onward, the necessary 
documented accommodation costs shall be reimbursed.

(LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance () If official travelers receive complimentary meals in the 
course of their official duties,  percent of the per diem for breakfast and  percent each for lunch 
and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld from the entitled per diem. The same applies 
if meals    are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable 
travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses. The percentages in sentences  and  shall 
also apply if the official traveler does not avail himself of the complimentary meals without a 
compelling reason.

stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days, from the eighth day

decisive.
Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part – Financial Impact: Additional 
costs estimated at , euros result from the climate compensation payment for officially required 
flights. The increases in certain compensations (for example, mileage allowance, travel cost 
reimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) are offset by savings in other provisions 
(restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains, adjustment of the reduction of the per diem 
in the case of complimentary meals in accordance with tax regulations). Savings that cannot 
currently be quantified arise from the reduction in administrative effort for the preparation and 
settlement of official travel. There is no additional implementation effort.

*   **Reimbursement of Travel and Flight Costs (§ ):** ""Necessary costs incurred for journeys...shall be reimbursed up to the cost of the lowest travel class."" This suggests that costs *directly* related to the journey, including potential costs incurred *during* the journey (like a layover if it involves necessary expenses), would be considered.
*   **Reimbursement of Other Costs (§ C):** This section covers expenses incurred in preparation for a trip, even if the trip is canceled. This *could* potentially cover costs related to a layover if the trip were interrupted.
*   **Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases:** Expenses are reimbursed when a trip is interrupted or terminated early. A layover causing an interruption could fall under this.

**Therefore, a layover would likely qualify for expense coverage if it involves ""necessary costs"" incurred during the journey or results in an interruption to the planned travel.** The specific expenses covered (e.g., meals, accommodation if the layover is extended) would be reimbursed up to the limits outlined in the Act (lowest travel class for flights, per diem allowances, etc.).",,Stopovers are disregarded unless they necessitate an overnight stay.,"Context: State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Scope

§  With the use of one’s own motor vehicle, there were previously three different rates (G, , and  
cents/km), depending on whether the vehicle’s engine capacity was above or below G ccm, 
whether compelling reasons existed for its use, and whether the vehicle was approved for 
official travel. In addition, the vehicle had to belong to the traveler or to a person living in a 
common household (which repeatedly led to problems, especially in non-marital partnerships). 
In the future, only two rates shall apply: –  cents if there is a significant official interest in the use 
of the vehicle. This includes employees who, under the law in force until December , , fulfilled 
the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel (in particular, field 
employees), as well as other employees when carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely 
disabled employees. The previous additional allowance of  cents/km for accompanying persons 
is eliminated. –  cents/km in all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another 
vehicle (for example, bicycle, e-bike). This rate is intended to cover the ongoing operating costs. 
With this new regulation, the formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official 
travel” is eliminated, as is the previously often cumbersome examination of whether compelling 
reasons exist. Furthermore, an incentive is created to use a bicycle or e-bike for shorter official 
trips. For the entitlement to mileage allowance, it is no longer required that the traveler uses a

Objective: The revision of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) is the first comprehensive 
restructuring of travel expense law since UU. The new regulations pursue the goal of reducing 
bureaucracy and meet the demand for a simplification of the application and settlement 
procedures and for straightforward rules. The previous travel expense law is outdated and 
requires updating and legal simplification to ease the conduct and administrative processing of 
official travel. Overall, the density of regulation is reduced ( instead of  paragraphs and the 
elimination of one regulation). Furthermore, regarding mobility behavior, the requirements of 
climate protection are to be considered (exemplary function of the state administration pursuant 
to §  of the Climate Protection Act).

official trips on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment, the per 
diem allowance (§ G) is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work. The per 
diem is granted until the end of the day of arrival, if from the following day onward a separation 
allowance for staying away is received; in addition, an accommodation allowance (§ ) is 
granted.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Reimbursement of Travel and 
Flight Costs () Necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport 
shall be reimbursed up to the cost of the lowest travel class. The highest competent authority or 
its authorized subordinate authority may permit exceptions for its area of responsibility. Flight 
costs are reimbursable if the official or economic reasons for using air travel outweigh the 
climate protection considerations. In principle, the costs of the lowest flight class shall be 
reimbursed. The Ministry of Finance may, by administrative regulation, determine exceptions.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance () For each full calendar 
day of an official trip, a per diem allowance of  euros is granted to compensate for additional 
expenses for meals. For an official trip lasting less than one full calendar day, on the day of 
departure and the day of return of a multi-day trip, the per diem allowance shall be: . . G euros 
for a duration of more than  hours, and  euros for a duration of more than  hours.

travelers who, according to paragraph , are to be reimbursed for travel or flight costs of the 
lowest class, if they have a disability degree of at least  percent, the expenses for the next 
higher class shall be reimbursed. The same concession may be granted to other official 
travelers if their physical or health condition justifies the use of this class.

(LRKG) §  Mileage Allowance ) If there is a significant official interest in the use of a motor 
vehicle, the mileage allowance shall be  cents per kilometer traveled. With the consent of the 
highest competent authority, a surcharge may be granted for the mileage allowance under 
sentence  if, due to the nature of the official business, journeys on unpaved roads or difficult-to-
drive field or forest tracks are regularly required. The surcharge amounts to  cents per 
kilometer.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding 
§  With the use of one’s own motor vehicle, there were previously three different rates (G, , and  
cents/km), depending on whether the vehicle’s engine capacity was above or below G ccm, 
whether compelling reasons existed for its use, and whether the vehicle was approved for 
official travel. In addition, the vehicle had to belong to the traveler or to a person living in a 
common household (which repeatedly led to problems, especially in non-marital partnerships). 
In the future, only two rates shall apply: –  cents if there is a significant official interest in the use 
of the vehicle. This includes employees who, under the law in force until December , , fulfilled 
the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel (in particular, field 
employees), as well as other employees when carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely 
disabled employees. The previous additional allowance of  cents/km for accompanying persons 
is eliminated. –  cents/km in all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another 
vehicle (for example, bicycle, e-bike). This rate is intended to cover the ongoing operating costs. 
With this new regulation, the formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official 
travel” is eliminated, as is the previously often cumbersome examination of whether compelling 
reasons exist. Furthermore, an incentive is created to use a bicycle or e-bike for shorter official 
trips. For the entitlement to mileage allowance, it is no longer required that the traveler uses a 
vehicle they own.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed 
Explanations Regarding § C For paragraph : The previous withholding provisions, which were 
separately regulated in §§  and  () LRKG, are now adapted to the tax law reduction provisions. 
As a result, tax-relevant amounts will occur only in very rare cases, which leads to a significant 
administrative simplification.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations  Regarding §  The 
regulations correspond to the previous §  LRKG (reimbursement of expenses for an extended 
stay at the business location). With the revision of the State Separation Allowance Regulation, 
the previously administratively cumbersome application procedure for extending the period 
during which separation allowance is received is rendered unnecessary.

§  With the use of one’s own motor vehicle, there were previously three different rates (G, , and  
cents/km), depending on whether the vehicle’s engine capacity was above or below G ccm, 
whether compelling reasons existed for its use, and whether the vehicle was approved for 
official travel. In addition, the vehicle had to belong to the traveler or to a person living in a 
common household (which repeatedly led to problems, especially in non-marital partnerships). 
In the future, only two rates shall apply: –  cents if there is a significant official interest in the use 
of the vehicle. This includes employees who, under the law in force until December , , fulfilled 
the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel (in particular, field 
employees), as well as other employees when carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely 
disabled employees. The previous additional allowance of  cents/km for accompanying persons 
is eliminated. –  cents/km in all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another 
vehicle (for example, bicycle, e-bike). This rate is intended to cover the ongoing operating costs. 
With this new regulation, the formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official 
travel” is eliminated, as is the previously often cumbersome examination of whether compelling 
reasons exist. Furthermore, an incentive is created to use a bicycle or e-bike for shorter official 
trips. For the entitlement to mileage allowance, it is no longer required that the traveler uses a 
vehicle they own.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  For paragraph : For reasons 
of administrative simplification and cost, in principle only the costs of second class shall be 
reimbursed. In the case of train journeys, with the current travel comfort, it is acceptable to use 
second class even over longer distances. The highest competent authority may permit 
exceptions for its area of responsibility. This strengthens the departments’ self- responsibility 
and enables flexible, needs-based handling. No specific travel time or distance is stipulated. For 
air travel, the previous differentiation according to salary groups as regulated in the State 
Foreign Travel Expense Regulation is abolished.
Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part – Financial Impact: Additional 
costs estimated at , euros result from the climate compensation payment for officially required 
flights. The increases in certain compensations (for example, mileage allowance, travel cost 
reimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) are offset by savings in other provisions 
(restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains, adjustment of the reduction of the per diem 
in the case of complimentary meals in accordance with tax regulations). Savings that cannot 
currently be quantified arise from the reduction in administrative effort for the preparation and 
settlement of official travel. There is no additional implementation effort.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  
For paragraph : For administrative economy reasons, official travelers are to have the free 
choice of means of transport while taking ecological and economic aspects into account. In 
particular, public transport should generally be given priority on long journeys. Whether and to 
what extent this will influence the mobility behavior of the travelers can be evaluated based on 
the corresponding data from the CO₂ balance of the state administration, which is compiled 
every three years. Otherwise, the regulations essentially correspond to the previous §  LRKG.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) 
§  Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement () The starting and ending points of an official 
trip are generally to be determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-
effectiveness. Deviating from this, the official superior may designate the official premises as the 
starting and/or ending point of the trip if the travel route runs immediately past the official 
premises. In the case of an official trip that is commenced and/or concluded at the traveler’s 
residence, the reimbursement of travel costs (§ ) or the mileage allowance (§ ) shall be based 
on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated as 
the starting and/or ending point. In the presence of several residences or accommodations, the 
one nearest to the official premises shall be decisive.
State Travel 
Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance () The duration of the official trip is determined 
from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the 
official premises or the beginning and/or end has been ordered at the official premises. In the 
case of several residences or accommodations, the one nearest to the official premises shall be 
decisive.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding § C For 
paragraph : This corresponds to the previous § U LRKG. Only the minimum duration justifying a 
claim to per diem is increased from exactly eight hours to more than eight hours. This 
corresponds to the tax regulation and is intended to avoid the administratively burdensome 
taxation of the per diem when the trip lasts exactly eight hours.

reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent. The official traveler is obliged to keep 
the cost receipts for one year after the reimbursement for purposes of audit and to present them 
upon request. Reimbursement of travel expenses and expenses incurred may be waived in 
whole or in part. Such a waiver must be declared in writing or electronically.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Reimbursement of Travel and 
Flight Costs () Necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport 
shall be reimbursed up to the cost of the lowest travel class. The highest competent authority or 
its authorized subordinate authority may permit exceptions for its area of responsibility. Flight 
costs are reimbursable if the official or economic reasons for using air travel outweigh the 
climate protection considerations. In principle, the costs of the lowest flight class shall be 
reimbursed. The Ministry of Finance may, by administrative regulation, determine exceptions.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Scope 
() The travel expense reimbursement includes: . . . . . Reimbursement of travel and flight costs 
(§ ), Mileage allowance (§ ), Per diem allowance for official trips (§ G), Necessary additional 
expenses on official errands (§ G), Accommodation allowance (§ ), G. Reimbursement of 
expenses incurred during an extended stay at the business location (§ ), . Expense and lump

lowest class, if they have a disability degree of at least  percent, the expenses for the next 
higher class shall be reimbursed. The same concession may be granted to other official

State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) 
§  Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement () The starting and ending points of an official 
trip are generally to be determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-
effectiveness. Deviating from this, the official superior may designate the official premises as the 
starting and/or ending point of the trip if the travel route runs immediately past the official 
premises. In the case of an official trip that is commenced and/or concluded at the traveler’s 
residence, the reimbursement of travel costs (§ ) or the mileage allowance (§ ) shall be based 
on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated as 
the starting and/or ending point. In the presence of several residences or accommodations, the 
one nearest to the official premises shall be decisive.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding 
§  With the use of one’s own motor vehicle, there were previously three different rates (G, , and  
cents/km), depending on whether the vehicle’s engine capacity was above or below G ccm, 
whether compelling reasons existed for its use, and whether the vehicle was approved for 
official travel. In addition, the vehicle had to belong to the traveler or to a person living in a 
common household (which repeatedly led to problems, especially in non-marital partnerships). 
In the future, only two rates shall apply: –  cents if there is a significant official interest in the use 
of the vehicle. This includes employees who, under the law in force until December , , fulfilled 
the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel (in particular, field 
employees), as well as other employees when carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely 
disabled employees. The previous additional allowance of  cents/km for accompanying persons 
is eliminated. –  cents/km in all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another 
vehicle (for example, bicycle, e-bike). This rate is intended to cover the ongoing operating costs. 
With this new regulation, the formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official 
travel” is eliminated, as is the previously often cumbersome examination of whether compelling 
reasons exist. Furthermore, an incentive is created to use a bicycle or e-bike for shorter official 
trips. For the entitlement to mileage allowance, it is no longer required that the traveler uses a 
vehicle they own.
State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance () For official errands, 
there is no entitlement to a per diem allowance according to paragraph . For errands lasting 
more than eight hours, the necessary documented expenses for meals shall be reimbursed up 
to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.
State Travel Expense Act 
(LRKG) §  Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases C () For 
official trips on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment, the per 
diem allowance (§ G) is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work. The per 
diem is granted until the end of the day of arrival, if from the following day onward a separation 
allowance for staying away is received; in addition, an accommodation allowance (§ ) is 
granted.
State Travel 
Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance () The duration of the official trip is determined 
from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the 
official premises or the beginning and/or end has been ordered at the official premises. In the

second class even over longer distances. The highest competent authority may permit 
exceptions for its area of responsibility. This strengthens the departments’ self- responsibility

Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part – Financial Impact: Additional 
costs estimated at , euros result from the climate compensation payment for officially required 
flights. The increases in certain compensations (for example, mileage allowance, travel cost 
reimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) are offset by savings in other provisions 
(restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains, adjustment of the reduction of the per diem 
in the case of complimentary meals in accordance with tax regulations). Savings that cannot 
currently be quantified arise from the reduction in administrative effort for the preparation and 
settlement of official travel. There is no additional implementation effort.

Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part  – 
Objective: The revision of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) is the first comprehensive 
restructuring of travel expense law since UU. The new regulations pursue the goal of reducing 
bureaucracy and meet the demand for a simplification of the application and settlement 
procedures and for straightforward rules. The previous travel expense law is outdated and 
requires updating and legal simplification to ease the conduct and administrative processing of 
official travel. Overall, the density of regulation is reduced ( instead of  paragraphs and the 
elimination of one regulation). Furthermore, regarding mobility behavior, the requirements of 
climate protection are to be considered (exemplary function of the state administration pursuant 
to §  of the Climate Protection Act).

Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  
For paragraph : Since accommodation allowance can only be granted for actual overnight stays, 
the time conditions of the previous §  () LRKG are no longer necessary. The administrative 
regulation of the Ministry of Finance on the State Travel Expense Act (LRKGVwV) shall 
establish guidelines for the amount of reimbursable costs.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed 
Explanations Regarding § C For paragraph : The previous withholding provisions, which were 
separately regulated in §§  and  () LRKG, are now adapted to the tax law reduction provisions. 
As a result, tax-relevant amounts will occur only in very rare cases, which leads to a significant 
administrative simplification.
Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part – Financial Impact: Additional 
costs estimated at , euros result from the climate compensation payment for officially required 
flights. The increases in certain compensations (for example, mileage allowance, travel cost 
reimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) are offset by savings in other provisions 
(restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains, adjustment of the reduction of the per diem 
in the case of complimentary meals in accordance with tax regulations). Savings that cannot 
currently be quantified arise from the reduction in administrative effort for the preparation and 
settlement of official travel. There is no additional implementation effort.
Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  For paragraph : This 
corresponds to the previous regulation in §  LRKG. The previous restriction for officials engaged 
in cross-border activities is eliminated.
State 
Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement () The entitlement 
to travel expense reimbursement expires if it is not applied for in writing or electronically within a 
limitation period of six months after the end of the official trip. The period begins the day after 
the end of the trip; in cases under §  (), it ends on the day the trip would have ended. The 
competent authorities may require the submission of the relevant cost receipts up to six months 
after the application. If these receipts are not submitted within one month upon request, the 
reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent. The official traveler is obliged to keep 
the cost receipts for one year after the reimbursement for purposes of audit and to present them 
upon request. Reimbursement of travel expenses and expenses incurred may be waived in 
whole or in part. Such a waiver must be declared in writing or electronically.
