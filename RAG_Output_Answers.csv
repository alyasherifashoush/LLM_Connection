The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically. 

Official trips also include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work, provided that certain conditions are met (specifically, the conditions of unspecified sentences 1 and 2).

Furthermore, for a judge carrying out judicial duties, the state commissioner for data protection performing their duties, or the government commissioner for the concerns of people with disabilities performing their duties, no order or approval is required for their official trips.

Finally, trips between the domestic territory and foreign countries, or within foreign countries with at least one business location abroad, are considered official trips abroad.",Yes

*   Finally, an “official trip abroad” is defined as **trips between the domestic territory and foreign countries, or within foreign countries, with at least one business location located abroad.**",Yes

Therefore, a hard copy is **not** strictly *required*, as electronic approval is sufficient. However, written approval is also acceptable, meaning a hard copy *could* be used.",Yes

According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § Official Trips and Errands, official trips “should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting the official business is not possible or reasonable.”

1. **Ordered or Approved Official Business:** Tasks or journeys specifically “ordered or approved by the responsible superior” (LRKG §2). This applies to both “official trips” (outside the usual place of work) and “official errands” (at the place of work or residence outside official premises). However, this requirement is waived for certain officials like judges and data protection commissioners when performing specific duties (LRKG §3).
2. **Judicial Duties/Specific Roles:** Duties related to a judge’s role in carrying out judicial duties or participating in court meetings are considered legitimate without needing prior order or approval (LRKG §3). Similarly, duties of the state commissioner for data protection and the government commissioner for the concerns of people with disabilities fall into this category.
3. **Training/Education:** Trips undertaken “for the purpose of education or training” are covered under the Act (LRKG §1), and expenses can be reimbursed, potentially with a reduction for officials on probation (LRKG §1).
4. **Secondary Activity at Request of Authority:** Official trips undertaken for a secondary activity *at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority* are also legitimate, though reimbursement is contingent on other bodies not already covering the costs (LRKG §5).



Essentially, if a superior *orders or approves* the task, or if it falls within the specifically defined duties of certain roles (like judges), or is related to official training, it's considered a legitimate, authorized task or duty under this Act. The Explanatory Memorandum for §2 also emphasizes the need to consider if a less costly method exists before authorizing a trip, indicating a duty to be economically mindful.",Yes

According to §1, the starting and ending points of an official trip are generally determined by the traveler based on cost-effectiveness.

Additionally, if the trip commences or concludes at the traveler’s residence, reimbursement is based on the distance from/to the residence *unless* the official premises have been designated as the starting/ending point. §5 further states that if ordered, the trip can commence or conclude at a vacation location, and reimbursement is calculated accordingly.

*   **Acceptability:** The text states that using second class is acceptable ""even over longer distances, with the current travel comfort.""

**Air Travel:**

*   **No Salary-Based Differentiation:** The previous system based on salary groups is abolished.
*   **Official/Economic Reasons:** Flight costs are reimbursable if ""official or economic reasons for using air travel outweigh the climate protection considerations."" This implies a higher class might be approved if justified by the nature of the trip or cost-effectiveness.
*   **Ministry of Finance Discretion:** The Ministry of Finance can determine exceptions via administrative regulation.

**Disability/Health Conditions:**

*   **Disability Degree:** Officials with a disability degree of at least 70% are automatically eligible for reimbursement of the next higher class.
*   **Physical/Health Condition:** Other officials may be granted the same concession if their ""physical or health condition justifies the use of this class.""

**Training/Education:**

*   **Attractiveness of Training:** The highest competent authority can refrain from reducing reimbursement for training-related travel to ""increase the attractiveness of training in the public service.""



In all cases, the key is that approval rests with the ""highest competent authority"" or their delegated subordinate, and is based on specific justifications—needs, economic factors, health, or encouraging professional development.",Yes

*   **Reimbursement of Other Costs (§ C):** This section covers expenses incurred in preparation for a trip, even if the trip is canceled. This *could* potentially cover costs related to a layover if the trip were interrupted.
*   **Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases:** Expenses are reimbursed when a trip is interrupted or terminated early. A layover causing an interruption could fall under this.

**Therefore, a layover would likely qualify for expense coverage if it involves ""necessary costs"" incurred during the journey or results in an interruption to the planned travel.** The specific expenses covered (e.g., meals, accommodation if the layover is extended) would be reimbursed up to the limits outlined in the Act (lowest travel class for flights, per diem allowances, etc.).",No

However, it does state the following:

*   **§ 2 LRKG:** For official travelers with a disability degree of at least percent, who are normally reimbursed for the lowest class of travel/flight costs, the expenses for the *next higher class* shall be reimbursed.
*   **Explanatory Memorandum B:** ...This includes employees who...as well as other employees when...carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely disabled employees.” which qualifies them for the **higher mileage rate of - cents/km** if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle.

Therefore, a person with a disability qualifying them for a higher travel class, and a significant official interest in using a vehicle, would receive a mileage allowance of **- cents/km**. The exact number of cents is not provided in the context.",Yes

The Explanatory Memorandum B states: “This includes employees who…carpooling is arranged…– [cents/km rate] if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle.”

**Previously:**

*   There were three different mileage rates based on engine capacity, compelling reasons for use, and vehicle approval for official travel.
*   The vehicle had to belong to the traveler or someone in their household – a requirement that often caused problems, especially for those in non-marital partnerships.

*   Only two rates apply:
    *   **[Amount] cents/km** if there is a ""significant official interest"" (including those previously approved for vehicle use, carpoolers, and severely disabled employees).
