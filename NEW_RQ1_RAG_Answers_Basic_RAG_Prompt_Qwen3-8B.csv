For train journeys, the limitation to second-class travel is based on the idea that, with current travel comfort levels, second class is sufficiently adequate even for longer distances. This decision aims to reduce costs while still allowing for necessary travel. The highest competent authority may grant exceptions for specific areas of responsibility, which allows for flexibility and promotes departments' self-responsibility in managing travel expenses.

Regarding the modification of daily allowance amounts, the changes align with tax law provisions, thereby eliminating the need to tax parts of the per diem. This adjustment simplifies the financial handling and ensures compliance with current legal standards. Additionally, the integration of foreign travel provisions into the main Act and general administrative regulations streamlines the regulatory framework, making it more efficient and reducing the need for separate, specialized regulations like the previous State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation.

In the future, the formal procedure for ""approval of one’s own vehicle for official travel"" is eliminated, and only two rates apply for mileage allowance: 35 cents/km if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle, and 25 cents/km in all other cases. The significant official interest includes employees who previously fulfilled the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel, as well as other employees when carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely disabled employees. 

Additionally, official trips must be ordered or approved by the responsible superior, unless an order or approval is not applicable due to the nature of the official’s office or the nature of the official business.
