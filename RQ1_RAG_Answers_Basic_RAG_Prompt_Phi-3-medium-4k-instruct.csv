1. Administrative simplification and cost reduction: By limiting first-class train use to only exceptional cases, the revised regulations aim to simplify the process of determining the appropriate class of travel for official trips. This change also helps to reduce costs, as second-class train travel is generally less expensive than first-class.

2. Ecological considerations: The revised regulations encourage the use of more environmentally friendly modes of transportation, such as public transport and bicycles, by giving them priority on long journeys. This change is intended to reduce the carbon footprint of official travel and promote sustainable mobility practices among travelers.

3. Adjustment of daily allowance amounts: The changes in daily allowance amounts, such as the reduction in the per diem for complimentary meals and the modification of mileage allowance rates, are intended to better reflect the actual costs of travel and to align with tax regulations. These adjustments also help to streamline the reimbursement process and reduce administrative burdens.
