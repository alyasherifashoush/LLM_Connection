For first-class train use:  
The rationale is that, in principle, only the costs of second-class travel are reimbursed. For train journeys, even over longer distances, second-class is acceptable due to current travel comfort. Exceptions may be permitted in specific cases, and this approach promotes self-responsibility and flexible, needs-based handling of travel expenses. No specific travel time or distance is mandated, allowing for more efficient and cost-effective reimbursement.

For daily allowance modifications:  
The daily allowance is adjusted to align with tax regulations, particularly in the case of complimentary meals.

Previously, the use of one's own motor vehicle was subject to three different rates depending on factors such as engine capacity, compelling reasons for use, and vehicle approval for official travel. Additionally, the vehicle had to belong to the traveler or a person in a common household, which often caused problems, especially in non-marital partnerships.

In the future, only two rates will apply:
1. **cents/km** if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle, which includes employees who meet certain criteria (e.g., field employees) and others when carpooling is arranged or for severely disabled employees.
2. **cents/km** in all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another vehicle (e.g., bicycle, e-bike), intended to cover ongoing operating costs.

The requirements for vehicle ownership have been simplified, and the formal approval process for using one's own vehicle for official travel has been eliminated. Additionally, the previous additional allowance of cents/km for accompanying persons is no longer provided.

2. **Official Trips and Errands**: The trip is considered an official trip if it is undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work and has been ordered or approved by the responsible superior.

3. **Official Trips Abroad**: If the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than a specified number of days (the exact number is not specified in the provided context), the foreign per diem allowance is reduced by a certain percentage from the tenth day onward. However, this reduction may be waived in justified cases. From the tenth day onward, documented accommodation costs are reimbursed instead of a lump sum accommodation allowance.

4. **Extended Stay and Separation Allowance**: For longer official trips and secondments, actual necessary accommodation costs are reimbursed, along with a lump sum to compensate for additional meal expenses for the first three months, instead of the previous lump-sum compensation.
