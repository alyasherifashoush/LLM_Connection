1. For official errands, there is no entitlement to a per diem allowance. However, for errands lasting more than eight hours, the necessary documented expenses for meals shall be reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.

2. If official travelers receive complimentary meals during their official duties, a percentage of the per diem for breakfast and each for lunch and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld from the entitled per diem. This also applies if meals are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses. The same percentages apply if the official traveler does not avail himself of the complimentary meals without a compelling reason.

3. The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises or the beginning and/or end has been ordered at the official premises. In the case of several residences or accommodations, the one nearest to the official premises shall be decisive.

4. For official trips abroad, the per diem and accommodation allowance shall be granted for the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time. If, during an official trip abroad, the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem shall be granted for the country of the last business location abroad.

5. If the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than a certain number of days, the foreign per diem according to the relevant paragraph shall be reduced by a certain percentage from the specified day onward. The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority may, in justified cases, waive the reduction.

6. For official trips on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment, the per diem allowance is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work. The per diem is granted until the end of the day of arrival, if from the following day onward a separation allowance for staying away is received; in addition, an accommodation allowance is granted.

7. For each full calendar day of an official trip, a per diem allowance of a specified amount in euros is granted to compensate for additional expenses for meals. For an official trip lasting less than one full calendar day, on the day of departure and the day of return of a multi-day trip, the per diem allowance shall be a specified amount for a duration of more than a certain number of hours.

8.

9.
