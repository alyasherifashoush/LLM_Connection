- **Reimbursement of other costs (§ 8)**: If official trips are canceled for reasons not attributable to the official traveler, necessary expenses incurred in preparation, which are eligible for reimbursement under this Act, shall be reimbursed.

- **Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases (§ 11)**: Expenses that arise due to interruption or early termination of a vacation or another private trip shall be reimbursed to an appropriate extent.

- **Reimbursement of Travel and Flight Costs (§ 1)**: For official travelers who, according to paragraph, are to be reimbursed for travel or flight costs of the lowest class, if they have a disability degree of at least 50 percent, the expenses for the next higher class shall be reimbursed.

- **Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases (§ 13)**: If an official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip, the travel expense reimbursement shall be calculated as if only the official trip were undertaken.

This section implies that when an official trip is combined with a vacation or private trip, the reimbursement for the official trip will be calculated separately, and the reimbursement for the combined trip will not exceed the reimbursement for the official trip.

1. **Bureaucracy reduction**: The objective of the revision is to reduce bureaucracy and simplify the application and settlement procedures for official travel. This is achieved by integrating the provisions into the State Travel Expense Act and eliminating redundant regulations.
2. **Simplification of rules**: The revision aims to simplify the rules and procedures for reimbursing travel expenses, making it easier for public officials to conduct official business.
3. **Mobility behavior consideration**: The new regulation considers the requirements of climate protection, which is an important aspect of the Climate Protection Act. This implies that the government is prioritizing the environment and taking into account the impact of travel on the climate.
4. **Cost optimization**: The elimination of special regulations and the reduction of bureaucracy are likely aimed at optimizing costs and making the travel expense system more efficient.
5. **Administrative simplification**: The revision is intended to strengthen the self-responsibility of departments and enable flexible handling of travel expenses, allowing them to make decisions based on specific needs and circumstances.

These factors contribute to the increased expenses outlined in the updated travel policy, which include the estimated costs of climate compensation payments for flights, the elimination of special regulations, and the simplification of the reimbursement rules.","Additional costs estimated at 250,000 euros result from the climate compensation payment for officially required flights.",Basic_RAG_Prompt,mpnet,False

The changes include:

1. **Limiting first-class train use**: By only reimbursing costs for second-class travel, the authorities aim to encourage the use of cheaper options, such as trains, which are more widely available and less expensive than first-class trains. This is intended to reduce the administrative burden and costs associated with managing travel expenses.

2. **Modifying daily allowance amounts**: The changes to the daily allowance amounts are aimed at aligning them with the costs of official travel, rather than the previous rates that were based on engine capacity and other factors. This is intended to reduce the administrative burden on the authorities and make it easier to manage travel expenses.

3. **Eliminating unnecessary regulations**: The elimination of the previous State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation and the integration of the new regulation into the State Travel Expense Act are intended to simplify the regulatory framework and reduce the administrative burden on the authorities.

4. **Introducing a new regulation for travel costs and mileage allowance**: The new regulation aims to provide a more modern and streamlined framework for managing travel expenses, while also promoting the use of cost-effective options for official travel.

5. **Removing special regulations**: The elimination of rarely occurring special regulations, such as the previous allowance for accompanying persons and the reduction of meal allowances, is intended to reduce the administrative burden and costs associated with managing these specific regulations.
