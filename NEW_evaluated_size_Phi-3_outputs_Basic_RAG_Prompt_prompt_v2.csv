1. Official travelers are entitled to a per diem allowance for official errands, but there is no entitlement for errands lasting more than eight hours. Instead, documented expenses for meals should be reimbursed up to the per diem amount for an official trip.

2. If official travelers receive complimentary meals or if meals are provided by a third party and included in reimbursable expenses, 20% of the per diem for breakfast and 40% each for lunch and dinner shall be withheld. This also applies if the official traveler does not avail themselves of the complimentary meals without a compelling reason.

3. The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises or the beginning and/or end has been ordered at the official premises. In such cases, the nearest accommodation shall be decisive.

4. For official trips abroad, the per diem and accommodation allowance shall be granted for the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time. If the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem shall be granted for the country of the last business location abroad.

5. If the stay at the same foreign business location lasts longer than 14 days, the foreign per diem is reduced by 25% from the 15th day onward. However, the reduction may be waived in justified cases. Instead of the lump sum accommodation allowance, documented accommodation costs shall be reimbursed from the 15th day onward.

6. For official trips on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment, the per diem allowance is granted until arrival at the new place of work. If a separation allowance for staying away is received, the per diem is granted until the end of the day of arrival.

7. The travel expense reimbursement includes travel and flight costs, mileage allowance, per diem allowance for official trips, necessary additional expenses on official errands, accommodation allowance, reimbursement of expenses incurred during an extended stay at the business location, and reimbursement of other costs.

8. Official trips are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, ordered or approved by the responsible superior, unless an order or approval is not applicable due to the nature of the official’s office or the nature of the official business. The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically.
