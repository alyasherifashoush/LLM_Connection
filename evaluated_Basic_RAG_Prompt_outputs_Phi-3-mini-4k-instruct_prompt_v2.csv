State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases () For official trips on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment, the per diem allowance (§ G) is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work. The per diem is granted until the end of the day of arrival, if from the following day onward a separation allowance for staying away is received; in addition, an accommodation allowance (§ ) is granted.

Explanatory Memorandum A. General Part – Essential Content: A revision of the State Travel Expense Act resulting in a modern regulatory framework. The focal points are: . . . . . . New regulation for travel costs and mileage allowance. Adjustment of the reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals to align with tax regulations: this regulation eliminates the taxation of parts of the per diem. The provisions for foreign travel are integrated into the Act and the general administrative regulations; the previous State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation becomes redundant and may lapse. Expenses during an extended stay at the business location, separation allowance: For longer official trips and secondments, instead of the previous lump-sum compensation, the actual necessary accommodation costs and, for the first three months, a lump sum to compensate for additional meal expenses shall be reimbursed. Elimination of rarely occurring special regulations. Statutory anchoring of a climate compensation payment for official flights.

Based on the context provided, the eligibility requirements for a separation allowance are as follows:

1. Officials and judges must be seconded to a location outside their official or residential area without a promise of moving expense reimbursement.
2. The separation allowance is granted for the necessary expenses incurred as a result of the secondment, taking into account the savings at home.
3. The same applies to temporary assignments for official reasons to another part of the employment authority and to temporary official duties at another institution than an office.
4. A secondment is deemed equivalent to an assignment under § of the Civil Servants Act.

This new regulation aims to address climate protection concerns by providing a financial incentive for the state administration to consider more environmentally friendly travel options. The additional costs estimated at € are a result of this climate compensation payment, which is designed to encourage the use of official flights that have a lower carbon footprint.

The updated travel policy also includes other changes that may contribute to increased expenses, such as the simplification and integration of regulations, the adjustment of per diem allowances in line with tax regulations, and the elimination of rarely occurring special regulations. These changes are intended to reduce bureaucracy and simplify the application and settlement procedures for official travel.

Overall, while the updated travel policy introduces some additional costs, it also aims to streamline the process and encourage more sustainable travel practices. The increased expenses are offset by savings in other provisions, such as the restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains and the adjustment of per diem allowances.

The context provided indicates that these changes are aimed at streamlining the process of reimbursing travel expenses for state officials, making it more efficient and economically viable.

For instance, the decision to limit first-class train use to only those cases where there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle is intended to encourage the use of more cost-effective travel options, such as second-class travel. This not only reduces the overall travel expenses but also promotes a more eco-friendly approach to official travel.

Similarly, the modification of daily allowance amounts, with the introduction of two rates for motor vehicle use (– cents/km for vehicles with significant official interest and – cents/km for all other cases), simplifies the reimbursement process. By eliminating the previous complex system of rates based on engine capacity and compelling reasons for vehicle use, the new regulation makes it easier for officials to understand and apply for reimbursements. This change also incentivizes the use of more economical and environmentally friendly modes of transportation, such as bicycles or e-bikes, for shorter official trips.

Overall, these changes are designed to reduce administrative burdens, promote cost-effectiveness, and encourage more sustainable travel practices among state officials."," The increases in certain compensations (for example, mileage allowance, travel cost reimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) are offset by savings in other provisions (restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains, adjustment of the",Basic_RAG_Prompt,mpnet,False,4,"The response accurately reflects the meaning of the reference, focusing on cost savings and administrative simplification offsetting increases in other areas.",3,"The response captures the core idea of the reference (offsetting savings), but doesn't mention the specific examples of increases in compensations like mileage allowance.",5,"The response is entirely based on information present in the context, without adding any external or contradictory details.",5,"The response directly and thoroughly addresses both aspects of the question: limiting first-class train use and modifying daily allowance amounts, providing detailed justification for each.",default,prompt_v2
