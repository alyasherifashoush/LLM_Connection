As for the daily allowance amounts, the Act has adjusted the reduction of the per diem allowance in the case of complimentary meals to align with tax regulations. This change eliminates the need to tax parts of the per diem, simplifying the process and reducing administrative burdens.

Furthermore, the Act has integrated the provisions for foreign trips into the Act and the general administrative regulations, making the previous State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation redundant. This integration is another step towards administrative simplification and cost reduction.
