The modification of daily allowance amounts is also aimed at simplifying procedures and reducing costs. The previous system had multiple rates for different circumstances, which led to problems, especially in non-marital partnerships. The new regulation eliminates the previous additional allowance of 2 cents/km for accompanying persons and introduces a single rate of 25 cents/km for all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another vehicle (e.g., bicycle, e-bike).

The changes are intended to promote a more flexible and needs-based approach to travel arrangements, allowing departments to make more efficient use of public transport and to reduce costs.
