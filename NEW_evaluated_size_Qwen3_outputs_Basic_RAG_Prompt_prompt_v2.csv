1. **Per Diem Allowance**: 
   - There is no entitlement to a per diem allowance for official errands unless the duration of the errand exceeds eight hours.
   - For errands lasting more than eight hours, the reimbursement is up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.
   - If meals are provided by a third party and included in the reimbursable expenses, the percentages (20% for breakfast, 40% for lunch and dinner) apply.

2. **Official Trips Abroad**:
   - The per diem and accommodation allowance are granted for the country the official traveler last reaches before midnight.
   - If the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem is granted for the country of the last business location abroad.
   - If the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) exceeds 14 days, the foreign per diem is reduced by 25% from the 15th day onward.

3. **Other Rules**:
   - The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure and arrival at the residence.
   - The one nearest to the official premises determines the reimbursement for multiple residences or accommodations.
   - The reimbursement includes travel and flight costs, mileage allowance, per diem for official trips, additional expenses, accommodation, and other costs.

1. **Time of Arrival**: The per diem and accommodation allowance is granted for the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time. If the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem is granted for the country of the last business location abroad.

2. **Duration of Trip**: The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises or the beginning and/or end has been ordered at the official premises. For multiple residences or accommodations, the one nearest to the official premises is decisive.

3. **Per Diem for Errands**: For official errands, there is no entitlement to a per diem allowance according to paragraph. For errands lasting more than eight hours, the necessary documented expenses for meals shall be reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.

4. **Special Cases**: For official trips on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment, the per diem allowance (§ G) is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work.

Instead of the lump sum accommodation allowance, from the 15th day onward, the necessary documented accommodation costs shall be reimbursed.

6. **Complimentary Meals**: If official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, 20 percent of the per diem for breakfast and 40 percent each for lunch and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld from the entitled per diem.

1. **Introduction of New Regulations**: The revised State Travel Expense Act introduces new regulations for travel costs and mileage allowance, which may result in higher reimbursement amounts compared to the previous system.

2. **Adjustment of Per Diem Allowance**: The per diem allowance for meals has been adjusted to align with tax regulations. This change may lead to higher reimbursement for meal expenses, as parts of the per diem are no longer taxable.

3. **Integration of Foreign Travel Provisions**: The provisions for foreign travel are now integrated into the Act and general administrative regulations, which may result in increased costs for international travel.

4. **Reimbursement of Accommodation and Meal Expenses**: For extended stays and secondments, the reimbursement of actual necessary accommodation costs and a lump sum for additional meal expenses is introduced. This could lead to higher expenses for longer trips.

5. **Climate Compensation Payment**: The statutory anchoring of a climate compensation payment for official flights adds to the overall cost of travel, as it is now required for officially required flights.

6. **Elimination of Special Regulations**: The removal of rarely occurring special regulations may not directly increase expenses, but it could lead to a more streamlined process, potentially involving higher administrative costs.

For **daily allowance modifications**: The changes reflect a **reduction in the per diem allowance** in cases where meals are complimentary, aligned with **tax law provisions** to eliminate the need for taxing parts of the per diem.

1. **Nature of the Trip**: Per diem allowance is granted for official trips, including those on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment. It is also applicable for errands lasting more than eight hours, where necessary documented expenses for meals are reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.

2. **Duration of the Trip**: The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises or the beginning and/or end has been ordered at the official premises. In the case of several residences or accommodations, the one nearest to the official premises shall be decisive.

3. **Complimentary Meals**: If official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, 20 percent of the per diem for breakfast and 40 percent each for lunch and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld from the entitled per diem. The same applies if meals are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses. The percentages in sentences 1 and 2 shall also apply if the official traveler does not avail himself of the complimentary meals without a compelling reason.

4. **Abroad Trips**: For official trips abroad, per diem and accommodation allowances are granted in accordance with the provisions of the current version of § of the Federal Foreign Travel Expense Regulation (ARV) and the general administrative regulation on the determination of foreign per diem and accommodation allowances (ARVVwV). If the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than 14 days, the foreign per diem according to paragraph shall be reduced by 25 percent from the 15th day onward. The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority may, in justified cases, waive the reduction.

5. **Combination with Private Trips**: If an official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip, the travel expense reimbursement shall be calculated as if only the official trip were undertaken.

The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically. Official trips also include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work, provided that the conditions of sentences 1 and 2 are otherwise met. Official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting the official business is not possible or reasonable.

7. **Per Diem Allowance Amount**: For each full calendar day of an official trip, a per diem allowance of 24 euros is granted to compensate for additional expenses for meals.

This means that the reimbursement for accommodation and other expenses will change after the seventh day of stay.

2. **Official Trips and Errands**: The trip must be an official trip, which is defined as a journey undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, ordered or approved by the responsible superior. The trip must meet the conditions of the Act, including written or electronic approval.

This decision aims to reduce costs while still allowing for necessary travel. The highest competent authority may grant exceptions for specific areas of responsibility, which allows for flexibility and promotes departments' self-responsibility in managing travel expenses.

Regarding the modification of daily allowance amounts, the changes align with tax law provisions, thereby eliminating the need to tax parts of the per diem. This adjustment simplifies the financial handling and ensures compliance with current legal standards. Additionally, the integration of foreign travel provisions into the main Act and general administrative regulations streamlines the regulatory framework, making it more efficient and reducing the need for separate, specialized regulations like the previous State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation.

1. For official errands, there is no entitlement to a per diem allowance. However, for errands lasting more than eight hours, the necessary documented expenses for meals shall be reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.

2. If official travelers receive complimentary meals during their official duties, 20 percent of the per diem for breakfast and 40 percent each for lunch and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld from the entitled per diem. This also applies if meals are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses. The same percentages apply if the official traveler does not avail themselves of the complimentary meals without a compelling reason.

3. The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises or the beginning and/or end has been ordered at the official premises. In the case of several residences or accommodations, the one nearest to the official premises shall be decisive.

4. For official trips abroad, the per diem and accommodation allowance shall be granted for the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time. If, during an official trip abroad, the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem shall be granted for the country of the last business location abroad.

5. If the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than 14 days, the foreign per diem according to the relevant paragraph shall be reduced by 25 percent from the 15th day onward. The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority may, in justified cases, waive the reduction. Instead of the lump sum accommodation allowance, from the 15th day onward, the necessary documented accommodation costs shall be reimbursed.

6. For official trips on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment, the per diem allowance (§ G) is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work. The per diem is granted until the end of the day of arrival, if from the following day onward a separation allowance for staying away is received; in addition, an accommodation allowance (§ ) is granted.

7. For each full calendar day of an official trip, a per diem allowance of 24 euros is granted to compensate for additional expenses for meals. For an official trip lasting less than one full calendar day, on the day of departure and the day of return of a multi-day trip, the per diem allowance shall be: 6 euros for a duration of more than 8 hours, and 12 euros for a duration of more than 14 hours.

8. Official trips in the sense of this Act are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which have been ordered or approved by the responsible superior, unless an order or approval is not applicable due to the nature of the official’s office or the nature of the official business. The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically. Official trips also include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work, provided that the conditions of the relevant sentences are otherwise met. Official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting the official business is not possible or reasonable.

9. Per diem and accommodation allowances abroad shall be granted in accordance with the provisions of the current version of § of the Federal Foreign Travel Expense Regulation (ARV) and the general administrative regulation on the determination of foreign per diem and accommodation allowances (ARVVwV).","For errands lasting more than eight hours, the necessary documented expenses for meals shall be reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.",Basic_RAG_Prompt,mpnet,False,5,"The response accurately conveys the meaning of the reference, even though it provides significantly more detail.",2,"The response goes far beyond the single sentence in the reference, detailing many rules not present in the reference text.",5,The response does not contain any information that contradicts the provided context.
