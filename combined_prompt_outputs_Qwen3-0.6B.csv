- **Official trips** are journeys undertaken to conduct **official business** outside the usual place of work.
- The journey must be **ordered or approved by the responsible superior**, unless it is not applicable due to the nature of the official’s office or business.
- The order or approval must be given in **writing or electronically**.
- **Official trips also include** journeys from a **temporary residence** to the place of work, provided the conditions of sentences  and are otherwise met.
- The trip must be carried out **only if a less costly method** of conducting the official business is not possible or reasonable.

### **2. Reasoning Through the Answer**
- An **official trip** is a journey that fulfills the purpose of conducting **official business** outside the workplace.
- It requires **ordering or approval** by the superior.
- It must be **approved in writing or electronically**.
- It can also include travel from a **temporary residence** to the workplace.

1. **Key Facts**:
   - The **State Travel Expense Act (LRKG)** includes provisions for **official trips and errands**.
   - Official trips are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, approved by the responsible superior.
   - They may involve journeys from a temporary residence to the place of work.
   - Certain official trips (e.g., for judges, state commissioners, and government officials) do not require an order or approval.
   - Official trips abroad must include at least one business location abroad.
   - The reimbursement of travel expenses is allowed under specific conditions.

2. **Reasoning**:
   - The **approval for official travel** is not required in some cases (e.g., for judges, state commissioners, and government officials).
   - In other cases, such as for official trips to conduct business abroad, the travel must be approved in writing or electronically.
   - The **approval must be given in writing or electronically** for most official trips.

### Step 1: Identify Key Facts

- The **State Travel Expense Act (LRKG)** has provisions related to **travel authorization**.
- **Section C** of the Act states: ""Alternatives None"" and includes ""Travel Authorization"" as a requirement.
- **Section D** (Travel Expense Reimbursement) also mentions that reimbursement must be **applied for in writing or electronically**.
- **Section E** (Costs for Private Individuals) and **Section C** (Alternatives) state that travel authorization is not required for certain types of official trips.
- **Section B** (Detailed Explanations) clarifies that ""relevant residence"" for travel expense law has been defined.

### Step 2: Reasoning Through the Answer

- **Travel authorization** is required for **official trips** (e.g., to conduct official business, attend meetings, or perform duties in a public office).
- The **terms ""order or approval""** in these provisions imply that travel authorization is necessary for such trips.
- However, **Section B** clarifies that ""relevant residence"" for travel expense law has been defined, which may imply that travel authorization is not strictly required for certain types of trips.
- Therefore, the answer depends on the specific type of official trip and whether the **relevant residence** is considered a temporary residence or not.

### Final Answer:

**A hard copy is not required for travel authorization.** The requirement depends on the nature of the official trip and whether the ""relevant residence"" is considered a temporary one.",The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically.,COT_Prompt,mpnet

1. **Key Facts:**
   - The **State Travel Expense Act (LRKG)** defines official trips as journeys to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, approved by the responsible superior.
   - These trips must be **ordered or approved in writing or electronically**.
   - Official trips also include journeys from a temporary residence to the place of work, provided certain conditions are met.

2. **Reasoning:**
   - If there is a **less expensive method** to conduct the official business, it **must be considered** before approval is given.

### Step 1: Identify Key Facts from the Context

- The **State Travel Expense Act (LRKG)** states:  
  *The starting and ending points of an official trip are generally to be determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness.*  
  This means the starting and ending points are determined based on cost-effectiveness.

- In **special cases**, the official superior may designate the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip if the travel route runs immediately past the official premises.  
  This allows the traveler to choose the official premises as the starting and/or ending point.

- In cases where the official trip is **commenced or concluded at the traveler’s residence**, the reimbursement is based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated.  
  This means the traveler can choose their residence as the starting point.

- In cases of **several residences or accommodations**, the **nearest to the official premises** is the decisive factor.  
  This means the traveler can choose the nearest location if it's official.

### Step 2: Reasoning Through the Answer

- The key fact is that the traveler has **influence** over the starting and ending points of the trip, especially in special cases where the official premises are involved.

- The **State Travel Expense Act** explicitly allows the traveler to choose the official premises as the starting point or end point of the trip.

### **Step 2: Reasoning Through the Answer**

Outside benefits can impact the reimbursement process in the following ways:

1. **Reimbursement Coverage**:
   - If your travel is covered under the State Travel Expense Act, your travel expenses are reimbursed based on the Act's provisions.
   - If your travel is covered by an outside benefit (e.g., a travel insurance company or a travel agency), this may mean your travel costs are already covered by that benefit, which could reduce or eliminate the need for reimbursement.

2. **Scope of Reimbursement**:
   - The reimbursement covers specific types of expenses, such as travel, flight, mileage, and accommodation.
   - If an outside benefit provides coverage for these expenses, it may already be included in your reimbursement.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If a trip is combined with a vacation or private trip, the reimbursement is calculated as if only the official trip is taken.
   - If a trip is canceled for reasons not attributable to the official traveler, the reimbursement is granted for the return journey.

4. **Exclusions**:

  Public transportation is generally **not** a complimentary mode of transport. Therefore, expenses for typical public transportation (e.g., buses, trains, trains) **are not** reimbursable under the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG).  

- **Exceptions**:  
  However, the Act allows reimbursement for travel costs using **regular public transport** up to the cost of the lowest travel class. This means that **expenses for typical public transportation** (e.g., regular bus or train travel) may be reimbursable if the travel is for official purposes and the travel class is not the lowest.  

### Final Answer:

**No**, expenses for typical public transportation are not reimbursable under the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) unless the travel is for official purposes and the travel class is not the lowest.",Necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport shall be reimbursed up to the cost of the lowest travel class.,COT_Prompt,mpnet

### Step 2: Reasoning Through the Answer

The question asks for the **daily expense rate** for business travel **that doesn't span a complete 24-hour period**.

From the context:

- The **per diem allowance** is set at **50% of the entitled per diem** in cases of **complimentary meals** in official trips.
- The **per diem allowance** is also **reimbursed** for **extended stays** at the business location.
- The **per diem allowance** is **reduced** for **complimentary meals** in official trips.
- The **per diem allowance** is **reimbursed** for **additional meal expenses** in the first three months.
- The **per diem allowance** is **reimbursed** for **accommodation** and **flight** costs.

The key point is that **the per diem allowance is not fully applied** for **complimentary meals** in official trips, and it is **reimbursement** for **extended stays**.

Therefore, the **daily expense rate for business travel that doesn't span a complete 24-hour period** is **less than 50% of the per diem allowance**, as it is **reimbursed** for **extended stays** and **complimentary meals**.

- **Separation allowance** is also provided for longer official trips.

**Key Facts:**
- The stay lasts longer than seven days.
- Reimbursement is granted for an extended stay at the same external business location.
- Days between arrival and departure are included in the stay.

**Reasoning:**
- The law specifies that if the stay exceeds seven days, the reimbursement is extended to the case of a secondment.
- The stay duration is counted from the eighth day onward, meaning the period of stay includes days after the initial seven-day period.
- The reimbursement is based on the same provisions as for a secondment, which typically covers longer stays at the same location.","If the stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days, from the eighth day onward the same reimbursement is granted as would be provided in the case of a secondment.

### **Key Facts:**
1. **Duration of Stay:** A business trip exceeding seven days (from the eighth day forward) is considered an ""extended stay"" under the State Travel Expense Act (SR) § 1.
2. **Reimbursement Rules:** If the stay lasts longer than seven days, the reimbursement is granted as if it were a secondment, meaning the same reimbursement applies as if someone were hired for the same role.
3. **Days of Stay:** All days between the day of arrival and the day of departure are counted as part of the stay.
4. **Official Trips:** If the trip is an official trip (to conduct official business outside the workplace, approved by a superior), the reimbursement applies.

### **Reasoning:**
- A business trip that exceeds seven days in duration (e.g., 8–30 days) is now subject to the same reimbursement rules as a secondment.
- This means that the reimbursement amount will be the same as if a secondment was granted, and the days of stay are included in the reimbursement calculation.
- The reimbursement for such trips is based on the same per diem provisions as if a secondment had been granted, ensuring that the cost is accounted for regardless of the length of the trip.

Thus, a business trip exceeding seven days in duration is now subject to the same reimbursement rules as a secondment, with all days counted toward the reimbursement amount.","If the stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days, from the eighth day onward the same reimbursement is granted as would be provided in the case of a secondment.

### **Key Facts:**
1. **Expense Allowance for Official Travel**:
   - Officials and judges who travel outside their official or residential area without a promise of moving expense reimbursement receive a **separation allowance**.
   - This allowance is based on the **savings at home** and is for **necessary expenses incurred**.

2. **Lump-Sum Reimbursement**:
   - The **highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority** may grant a **lump sum reimbursement** instead of the usual per diem, accommodation allowance, or individual components of reimbursement.

### **Reasoning:**
- A **single expense allowance** is typically used for **official travel** and **separation** (when traveling without a moving expense reimbursement). This is different from the usual **separate payments** for meals and hotels.
- The **separation allowance** is **not a separate payment** but a **one-time reimbursement** for the necessary expenses incurred during travel.
- This is in contrast to the **lump sum reimbursement** for extended stays or official trips, where payments are made in bulk.

### **Conclusion:**
You would receive a **single expense allowance** for official travel instead of the usual separate payments for meals and hotels **when traveling without a promise of moving expense reimbursement**.","Official travelers, for whom generally lower expenses for meals and accommodation are incurred, may, as determined by the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority, be compensated by an expense allowance in lieu of per diem, accommodation allowance, and reimbursement of expenses under § 8, corresponding to the necessary expenses.",COT_Prompt,mpnet

4. **Illness or hospitalization** may also lead to reimbursement of necessary expenses.

5. **Lump sum reimbursement** is not limited to specific scenarios but is a general rule for **regular or similar official trips**.

**Reasoning**:  
A lump sum reimbursement is typically granted **in lieu of the travel expense reimbursement** for **regular or similar official trips**. This is because the lump sum is a more flexible and direct form of reimbursement for official travel, especially when the expenses are significant or when a specific reimbursement is not applicable.","The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority may, for regular or similar official trips, grant a lump sum reimbursement in lieu of the travel expense reimbursement or individual components thereof, which is to be determined based on the average of the individual reimbursements otherwise incurred in a certain period.",COT_Prompt,mpnet

### **Key Facts:**
1. **Section 1 (Reimbursement of Other Costs):**
   - If official trips are canceled for reasons not attributable to the official traveler, the necessary expenses incurred in preparation are eligible for reimbursement.
   - The reimbursement applies to expenses incurred in preparation, not necessarily the actual trip itself.

2. **Section 2 (Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases):**
   - Expenses of the official traveler and accompanying persons arising from the interruption or early termination of a vacation are reimbursed.
   - This applies to expenses that could not be used due to these reasons.

3. **Section 3 (Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement):**
   - The entitlement to reimbursement expires within six months after the end of the official trip.
   - The period starts the day after the end of the trip, and it ends on the day the trip would have ended.
   - Competent authorities may require submission of receipts up to six months after the application.

4. **Section 4 (Waiver of Reimbursement):**
   - The traveler may waive all or part of the travel expense reimbursement, provided it is declared in writing or electronically.

- **If your travel plans are called off for reasons not attributable to the official traveler**, then the expenses incurred in preparation would be eligible for reimbursement.
- However, if the cancellation is due to official reasons, the reimbursement may be granted for the return journey from the vacation location to the official premises.
- The entitlement to reimbursement expires within six months after the end of the trip, so if your trip was called off within this period, your reimbursement would have already been processed.
- If the reimbursement was not applied for within six months, the application may be rejected.
- The traveler is required to keep receipts for one year after reimbursement for audit purposes and must submit them upon request.

- You **will not be able to get your money back** if your travel plans are called off, as the reimbursement has already been processed if the cancellation was due to non-official reasons. If the cancellation is due to official reasons, the reimbursement would have already been granted.

### Reasoning:
- The context explicitly states that the reimbursement is determined based on the **departure or arrival at the vacation location**, which aligns with the principle of cost-effectiveness and the specific terms of the State Travel Expense Act.

The key point is that when a business trip and a personal vacation coincide, the reimbursement is based on the official business conducted at the place of residence, unless the official premises are the starting or ending point. If the trip starts or ends at the same place, the reimbursement is calculated according to the specific rules for official trips and errands, and the extended stay at the business location is handled similarly.","If it is ordered or approved that the official trip is to commence or conclude at the vacation location, the travel expense reimbursement shall, contrary to paragraph 3, be calculated based on the departure from or arrival at that location.",COT_Prompt,mpnet

- The **State Travel Expense Act (LRKG)** § 1.1 states: *Expenses of the official traveler and any accompanying persons that arise due to the interruption or early termination of a vacation or another private trip shall be reimbursed to an appropriate extent.*

### Step 1: Identify Key Facts
- An airplane layover is a special case where an individual is traveling for business purposes, potentially for an extended stay or for a private trip.
- The travel expense reimbursement is subject to specific conditions outlined in the Act.
- The layover itself is considered a **special case**, and the reimbursement is based on the departure or arrival location.

- If the layover is due to an official trip (e.g., a business-related trip) and the traveler is treated as an official traveler, the layover itself is considered a **special case** and is treated as a business trip for reimbursement purposes.
- The reimbursement is based on the **departure or arrival location**, not the layover itself, as the layover is considered part of the travel for the business trip.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the reasons for the increased expenses outlined in the updated travel policy:

### **Step 1: Identify Key Facts**
- The updated travel policy introduces new regulations that include:
  - A revised **State Travel Expense Act** with updated provisions for travel costs, mileage allowances, and compensation for extended stays.
  - A **reduction in the per diem allowance** for complimentary meals, which is set to eliminate tax on parts of the per diem.
  - Changes to **foreign travel provisions**, integrating them into administrative regulations.
  - New **expenses** for **extended stays** at the business location, including a **separation allowance** and a **climate compensation payment**.
  - The **reduction of certain travel expenses** and the **elimination of special regulations** that were previously used.

### **Step 2: Reasoning Through the Answer**
The increased expenses can be attributed to the following factors:

1. **New Per Diem Allowance Reduction**:
   - The previous per diem for complimentary meals was reduced, but it was set to **eliminate the need to tax parts of the per diem**.
   - This means that **taxation on some portions of the per diem** was removed, potentially saving money.

2. **Integration of Foreign Travel Provisions**:
   - The regulations for foreign travel were incorporated into the general administrative regulations, which may have increased administrative complexity and costs.

3. **Extended Stay Compensation**:
   - For longer official trips, the new provisions require **reimbursement of actual accommodation costs** and a **lump sum** for additional meal expenses.
   - This changes the previously simplified structure of compensation for extended stays, increasing the overall cost.

4. **Climate Compensation Payment**:
   - The **climate compensation payment** was introduced to cover officially required flights, which may have increased the financial burden for public budgets.

5. **Elimination of Special Regulations**:
   - The policy eliminates **rarely occurring special regulations**, which could have been a cost-effective reduction in administrative efforts.

6. **Simplified Administrative Procedures**:
   - The policy aims to **simplify the application and settlement procedures** and reduce the **density of regulations**.
   - This simplification could lead to **lower administrative costs** for both the state and the individuals involved.

### Step 1: Identify Key Facts
- **Limiting first-class train use**: The revised regulations aim to reduce the number of first-class train bookings, which is a measure to simplify administrative processes and lower costs.
- **Modifying daily allowance amounts**: This change is intended to align with tax regulations and reduce the burden on public funds.

### Step 2: Reasoning for Limiting First-Class Train Use

1. **Per Diem Allowance Duration**:
   - The duration of an official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises or the beginning and/or end have been ordered at the official premises.
   - In cases where multiple residences or accommodations are involved, the one nearest to the official premises is decisive.

2. **Per Diem Allowance for Official Trips Abroad**:
   - The per diem and accommodation allowance are granted for the country the traveler last reaches before midnight local time.
   - If the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, the foreign per diem is granted for the country of the last business location abroad.
   - If the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than 8 days, the foreign per diem is reduced by 1% from the 8th day onward.
   - The reduction is justified if it is in accordance with the tax regulations.

3. **Per Diem Allowance for Official Errands**:
   - For errands lasting more than 8 hours, the necessary documented expenses for meals are reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.
   - For official trips lasting less than a full calendar day, a per diem allowance of 1 euro is granted for each full calendar day of the trip.
   - For a multi-day trip lasting more than 8 hours, the per diem allowance is **G euros** for a duration of more than 8 hours, and **G euros** for a duration of more than 8 hours.

1. **Key Facts**:
   - The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance states that official travelers receive a **per diem allowance of euros** for each full calendar day of an official trip.
   - It also specifies that if meals are provided by a third party and the charge is included in reimbursable expenses, the **percentages for breakfast, lunch, and dinner** are withheld.

2. **Reasoning**:
   - The allowance includes **complimentary meals** in the course of official duties. 
   - If meals are provided by a third party and included in reimbursement, the **per diem for breakfast, lunch, and dinner** is withheld.
   - The percentages apply **only** if meals are provided by a third party and the reimbursement includes the charge.

### Step 1: Identify Key Facts from the Context

- **The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance** states:  
  ""If official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, the percent of the per diem for breakfast and percent each for lunch and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld from the entitled per diem.""

- **Another provision** states:  
  ""The same applies if meals are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses.""

- **Explanatory Memorandum B** further clarifies that:  
  ""Breakfast as a meal component shall henceforth be taken into account in the per diem by withholding percent of the full per diem.""

- **Additional context** includes:  
  - The duration of the official trip is determined based on departure and arrival times, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises.

### Step 2: Reasoning Through the Answer

- **Breakfast is explicitly mentioned** in the context as part of the per diem allowance.  
- The rule explicitly states that if meals are provided in the course of official duties, the per diem allowance for breakfast is withheld.  
- The rule also applies to meals provided by a third party, and the percentage is included in the reimbursement.  
- The mention of ""henceforth"" in the explanatory memorandum suggests that the requirement for breakfast in the per diem allowance is still in effect.

### Final Answer:

Yes, breakfast is covered by the per diem rate as it is explicitly included in the provisions of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance.","Finally, the regulation for accommodation costs that include breakfast is no longer included.",COT_Prompt,mpnet

### Key Facts:
1. **State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance ()** states that if official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, a specific percentage of the per diem allowance for breakfast, lunch, and dinner is withheld.  
2. This percentage applies if meals are provided by a third party and the charge is included in reimbursable expenses (travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental).  
3. The same percentage applies if meals are not provided by the official traveler without a compelling reason.  
4. For official errands lasting more than 8 hours, the reimbursed meals are up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.

### Reasoning:
- The per diem allowance includes a percentage of meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for a full calendar day, as specified in the Act.  
- The context explicitly states that these percentages are withheld if meals are provided by a third party.  
- Therefore, **per diem payments will include a breakfast expense** under the stated conditions.","Finally, the regulation for accommodation costs that include breakfast is no longer included.",COT_Prompt,mpnet

1. **Key Facts**:
   - The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance states that if official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, the **per diem allowance for breakfast** shall be withheld.
   - This applies to both **official travelers** receiving meals in their official duties and **third-party meals** that are included in reimbursable expenses.

2. **Reasoning**:
   - The per diem allowance is **withheld** for meals that are provided by the official traveler themselves or by a third party, as stated in the context.
   - If meals are provided by a third party and the charge is included in the reimbursable expenses, the per diem will **not** include breakfast.
   - The percentages in the context are also applied if the traveler does not avail of the complimentary meals without a compelling reason.

Thus, **the per diem will not consider breakfast** as part of the entitlement unless meals are provided by the official traveler or a third party.","Breakfast as a meal component shall henceforth be taken into account in the per diem by withholding 20 percent of the full per diem.

   - The policy includes new provisions for travel costs, meal allowances, and other expenses related to secondments and training.

2. **Reasoning**:
   - The policy reduces the need for a new application to maintain separation allowance payments beyond the initial period.
