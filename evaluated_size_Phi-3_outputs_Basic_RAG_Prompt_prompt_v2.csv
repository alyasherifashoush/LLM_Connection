1. Official travelers are entitled to a per diem allowance for official errands, but there is no entitlement for errands lasting more than eight hours. In such cases, documented expenses for meals should be reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.

2. If official travelers receive complimentary meals during their official duties, a certain percentage of the per diem for breakfast and lunch and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld.

5. If the stay at the same foreign business location lasts longer than a certain number of days, the foreign per diem shall be reduced by a certain percentage from the th day onward. However, the highest competent authority may waive the reduction in justified cases.

1. The nature of the trip: The per diem allowance is granted for official trips, errands lasting more than eight hours, and for the period until arrival at the new place of work in the case of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment.

2. Duration of the trip: The per diem allowance is granted for each full calendar day of an official trip. For a trip lasting less than one full calendar day, a per diem allowance is granted for the day of departure and the day of return of a multi-day trip.

3. Location of the trip: Per diem and accommodation allowances abroad are granted in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Foreign Travel Expense Regulation (ARV) and the general administrative regulation on the determination of foreign per diem and accommodation allowances (ARVVwV).

4. Additional factors: If official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, a certain percentage of the per diem for breakfast and lunch and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld from the entitled per diem. The same applies if meals are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses.

5. Duration of stay at the same foreign business location: If the stay at the same foreign business location lasts longer than a certain number of days, the foreign per diem shall be reduced by a certain percentage from a specific day onward.

6. Official trips abroad: The per diem and accommodation allowance shall be granted for the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time. If, during an official trip abroad, the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem shall be granted for the country of the last business location abroad.

7. Expense and lump sum reimbursement: Official travelers, for whom generally lower expenses for meals and accommodation are incurred, may be compensated by an expense allowance in lieu of per diem, accommodation allowance, and reimbursement of expenses under certain conditions.

2. Official Trips and Errands: Official errands are journeys undertaken to conduct official business at the place of work or residence outside the official premises, which have been ordered or approved by the responsible superior.

3. Official Trips Abroad: Official trips abroad are trips between the domestic territory and foreign countries as well as within foreign countries. At least one business location must be located abroad.

4. Official Trips Abroad: If the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than a certain number of days, the foreign per diem according to paragraph shall be reduced by a certain percentage from the th day onward.
