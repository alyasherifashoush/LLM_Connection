1. **Introduction of New Regulations**: The revised State Travel Expense Act introduces new regulations for travel costs and mileage allowance, which may result in higher reimbursement amounts compared to the previous system.

2. **Adjustment of Per Diem Allowance**: The per diem allowance for meals has been adjusted to align with tax regulations. This change may lead to higher reimbursement for meal expenses, as parts of the per diem are no longer taxable.

3. **Integration of Foreign Travel Provisions**: The provisions for foreign travel are now integrated into the Act and general administrative regulations, which may result in increased costs for international travel.

4. **Reimbursement of Accommodation and Meal Expenses**: For extended stays and secondments, the reimbursement of actual necessary accommodation costs and a lump sum for additional meal expenses is introduced. This could lead to higher expenses for longer trips.

5. **Climate Compensation Payment**: The statutory anchoring of a climate compensation payment for official flights adds to the overall cost of travel, as it is now required for officially required flights.

6. **Elimination of Special Regulations**: The removal of rarely occurring special regulations may not directly increase expenses, but it could lead to a more streamlined process, potentially involving higher administrative costs.
