Question: What is an official trip?
Answer: According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG), an official trip is a journey undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which has been ordered or approved by the responsible superior, unless an order or approval is not applicable due to the nature of the official’s office or the nature of the official business. The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically. 

Official trips also include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work, provided that certain conditions are met (specifically, the conditions of unspecified sentences 1 and 2).

Furthermore, for a judge carrying out judicial duties, the state commissioner for data protection performing their duties, or the government commissioner for the concerns of people with disabilities performing their duties, no order or approval is required for their official trips.

Finally, trips between the domestic territory and foreign countries, or within foreign countries with at least one business location abroad, are considered official trips abroad.

Question: Could you explain what constitutes a legitimate, authorized task or duty?
Answer: Based on the provided text, a legitimate, authorized task or duty is one that falls into several categories:

1. **Ordered or Approved Official Business:** Tasks or journeys specifically “ordered or approved by the responsible superior” (LRKG §2). This applies to both “official trips” (outside the usual place of work) and “official errands” (at the place of work or residence outside official premises). However, this requirement is waived for certain officials like judges and data protection commissioners when performing specific duties (LRKG §3).
2. **Judicial Duties/Specific Roles:** Duties related to a judge’s role in carrying out judicial duties or participating in court meetings are considered legitimate without needing prior order or approval (LRKG §3). Similarly, duties of the state commissioner for data protection and the government commissioner for the concerns of people with disabilities fall into this category.
3. **Training/Education:** Trips undertaken “for the purpose of education or training” are covered under the Act (LRKG §1), and expenses can be reimbursed, potentially with a reduction for officials on probation (LRKG §1).
4. **Secondary Activity at Request of Authority:** Official trips undertaken for a secondary activity *at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority* are also legitimate, though reimbursement is contingent on other bodies not already covering the costs (LRKG §5).



Essentially, if a superior *orders or approves* the task, or if it falls within the specifically defined duties of certain roles (like judges), or is related to official training, it's considered a legitimate, authorized task or duty under this Act. The Explanatory Memorandum for §2 also emphasizes the need to consider if a less costly method exists before authorizing a trip, indicating a duty to be economically mindful.

Answer: According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement, the starting and ending points of an official trip are **generally** determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness. 

However, there are exceptions:

*   The official superior may designate the official premises as the starting and/or ending point if the travel route runs immediately past them.

Question: Are travel costs covered when the trip is primarily for something other than work?
Answer: Based on the provided text, travel costs *are* covered, to an extent, when the trip is combined with a private trip (like a vacation). Specifically:

* **§ 12 (Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases)** states that if an official trip is combined with a vacation or other private trip, the reimbursement is calculated "as if only the official trip were undertaken." 
* **§ 12** also clarifies that the reimbursement cannot exceed what it would have been for *just* the official portion of the trip.
* **§ 12** further states that expenses arising from interrupting or terminating a vacation *for* the official trip are reimbursable "to an appropriate extent," as are expenses that couldn’t be used because of the official trip.

However, the act prioritizes official business. **§ 1 (Official Trips)** states official trips should only be undertaken if a less costly method of conducting the business is not possible or reasonable.

Question: If I waive my right to reimbursement from another organization, can I still receive reimbursement under this regulation, or am I considered to be covered by the other organization?
Answer: According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement, travelers are entitled to reimbursement under this Act *to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip*. Critically, this applies **even if the traveler has waived his or her claim against that body.**

Therefore, waiving your right to reimbursement from another organization does **not** automatically disqualify you from receiving reimbursement under this regulation. You are still eligible for reimbursement under the LRKG to the extent the other body *would have* provided it, despite your waiver. However, if the other body *does* provide reimbursement, even if you waive your claim, you won’t receive it under the LRKG.

Question: If I choose not to seek payment from a different entity, does that affect my eligibility for reimbursement under these rules, or would that other entity be considered my primary coverage?
Answer: According to § (Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement), travelers are entitled to reimbursement under this Act *to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip*. Critically, this applies **even if the traveler has waived his or her claim against that body.**

Therefore, whether you *choose* not to seek payment from another entity is irrelevant. The existence of another potential source of reimbursement – and whether it *would* provide it – is what matters. That other entity is considered your primary coverage, and your reimbursement under the LRKG is limited accordingly.

Answer: Here's a breakdown of the circumstances where reimbursement for a higher class of travel is permitted, based solely on the provided text:

1. **Disability:** If an official traveler has a disability degree of at least 50 percent, they are reimbursed for the next higher class of travel (LRKG § 2).
2. **Medical Condition:** Reimbursement for a higher class may be granted to other official travelers if their physical or health condition justifies its use (LRKG § 2).
3. **Exceptions by Authority:** The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority may permit exceptions to the rule of reimbursing only the lowest travel class for both train and air travel (LRKG § 3).
4. **Official/Economic Reasons for Flights:** Flight costs (and potentially a higher class) are reimbursable if official or economic reasons for using air travel outweigh climate protection considerations (LRKG § 3).

Question: Could you please explain the situations that allow for approval of travel expenses beyond standard class?
Answer: Here's an explanation of the situations allowing for approval of travel expenses beyond standard class, based solely on the provided text:

**Train Travel:**

*   **General Principle:** While second class is the standard, the "highest competent authority may permit exceptions for its area of responsibility." This allows for flexibility based on needs.
*   **Acceptability:** The text states that using second class is acceptable "even over longer distances, with the current travel comfort."

**Air Travel:**

*   **No Salary-Based Differentiation:** The previous system based on salary groups is abolished.
*   **Official/Economic Reasons:** Flight costs are reimbursable if "official or economic reasons for using air travel outweigh the climate protection considerations." This implies a higher class might be approved if justified by the nature of the trip or cost-effectiveness.
*   **Ministry of Finance Discretion:** The Ministry of Finance can determine exceptions via administrative regulation.

**Disability/Health Conditions:**

*   **Disability Degree:** Officials with a disability degree of at least 70% are automatically eligible for reimbursement of the next higher class.
*   **Physical/Health Condition:** Other officials may be granted the same concession if their "physical or health condition justifies the use of this class."

**Training/Education:**

*   **Attractiveness of Training:** The highest competent authority can refrain from reducing reimbursement for training-related travel to "increase the attractiveness of training in the public service."



In all cases, the key is that approval rests with the "highest competent authority" or their delegated subordinate, and is based on specific justifications—needs, economic factors, health, or encouraging professional development.

Question: Are employees reimbursed for expenses incurred while completing work-related tasks away from their usual work location?
Answer: Yes, employees are reimbursed for expenses incurred while completing work-related tasks away from their usual work location. 

Here's how the provided text supports this:

* **§ Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement:** This section outlines the general principle of cost-effectiveness for determining starting and ending points of "official trips."
* **§ Scope:** This section explicitly states that travel expense reimbursement *includes* things like:
    * Reimbursement of travel and flight costs
    * Mileage allowance
    * Per diem allowance for official trips
    * Necessary additional expenses on official errands
    * Accommodation allowance
    * Expense and lump sum reimbursement
    * Reimbursement of other costs 

These all point to covering costs associated with being away from one’s usual work location to perform official duties. Additionally, several sections detail reimbursements in *special cases* of travel, further reinforcing the overall principle of expense coverage for work-related travel.

Question: What are the rules regarding per diem and official business?
Answer: Here's a breakdown of the rules regarding per diem and official business, based solely on the provided text:

**1. Basic Per Diem Allowance (§ C):**

*   A full calendar day of an official trip grants a per diem to cover meal expenses (the specific amount in euros is not stated, only that it *is* granted).
*   For trips less than a full day, the per diem is different on departure/return days:
    *   More than X hours: G euros
    *   More than Y hours: Z euros (X, Y, G, and Z are not defined in the text)

**2. Complimentary/Provided Meals (§ C):**

*   If meals are complimentary during official duties, or provided and included in other reimbursable expenses (travel, flight, accommodation), a percentage of the per diem is withheld:
    *   Breakfast: X%
    *   Lunch & Dinner: Y% each (X and Y are not defined in the text)
*   This withholding *also* applies if the traveler declines complimentary meals without a valid reason.

**3. Official Trips Abroad (§ & § ):**

*   Per diem and accommodation are based on the country reached *before midnight local time*.
*   If a domestic location is reached last before midnight during a foreign trip, the foreign per diem applies to the last foreign business location.
*   For stays longer than N days at the same foreign location (N is not defined in the text):
    *   Per diem is reduced by M% from the (N+1)th day onward (M is not defined in the text).
    *   Accommodation allowance switches from a lump sum to reimbursement of documented costs from the (N+1)th day onward.

**4. Official Errands (§ C):**

*   No per diem for errands lasting eight hours or less.
*   For errands lasting *more than* eight hours, documented meal expenses are reimbursed *up to* the amount of the standard per diem for a full trip.

*   Trip duration is calculated from departure/arrival at the traveler’s residence (or nearest to official premises if multiple residences exist).

**6. Transfers/Secondments (§ ):**

*   Per diem is granted until arrival at the new place of work.
*   If a separation allowance begins the day after arrival, per diem is granted until the end of the arrival day, *plus* an accommodation allowance.

**7. General Changes & Explanations (Explanatory Memoranda):**

*   The Act aims to modernize travel expense regulations and align with tax laws.
*   A minimum duration of *more than* eight hours is now required to claim per diem (previously exactly eight hours).
*   Breakfast is now factored into the per diem by withholding X% (the percentage is mentioned elsewhere in the text).



**Important Note:** The text frequently refers to specific amounts (euros, percentages, number of days) using variables (X, Y, G, N, M, Z) that are *not defined* within the provided context. Therefore, a complete understanding of the rules requires access to the full State Travel Expense Act.

Additionally, the **Explanatory Memorandum A** states that for longer official trips and secondments, instead of a lump-sum compensation, the actual necessary accommodation costs and, for the first three months, a lump sum to compensate for additional meal expenses shall be reimbursed.

Finally, regarding foreign trips (**State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §**), if the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than days, the foreign per diem is reduced by percent from the th day onward, with potential for waiver by authorities and a shift to documented accommodation cost reimbursement from the th day onward.

Question: Under what circumstances during work travel would I get one payment to cover all costs, rather than being reimbursed individually for things like food and lodging?
Answer: According to the provided texts, you would get one payment to cover all costs – an “expense allowance” – instead of individual reimbursements for meals, accommodation, and other expenses **if** you are an official traveler for whom generally lower expenses for meals and accommodation are incurred. 

This is determined by “the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority” and corresponds to your “necessary expenses.” (See: State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § U Expense and Lump Sum Reimbursement).

Question: Under what circumstances is a single payment used to cover travel costs, rather than standard expense reporting?
Answer: According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § U (Expense and Lump Sum Reimbursement), a single expense allowance is used *in lieu of* per diem, accommodation allowance, and reimbursement of expenses under § G for official travelers “for whom generally lower expenses for meals and accommodation are incurred.” This is determined by the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority and corresponds to the necessary expenses. 

Essentially, if someone is expected to have significantly lower travel costs than the standard allowances cover, they can receive a single payment to cover those costs instead of submitting detailed expense reports for each item.

* **§ Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement:** States the starting and ending points of an official trip are determined by cost-effectiveness, implying travel *to* a different location for work is what qualifies.
* **Explanatory Memorandum B regarding §:** Clarifies the definition of "residence" in travel expense law is intended to *avoid* reimbursing privately incurred high travel costs – meaning regular commutes are not the intention of the act.

Question: Could you clarify the circumstances that would qualify an airplane layover for expense coverage under the travel reimbursement act?
Answer: The provided text doesn't specifically address airplane layovers. However, it does outline the general principles for travel and flight cost reimbursement. Here's what we can infer from the text:

*   **Reimbursement of Travel and Flight Costs (§ ):** "Necessary costs incurred for journeys...shall be reimbursed up to the cost of the lowest travel class." This suggests that costs *directly* related to the journey, including potential costs incurred *during* the journey (like a layover if it involves necessary expenses), would be considered.
*   **Reimbursement of Other Costs (§ C):** This section covers expenses incurred in preparation for a trip, even if the trip is canceled. This *could* potentially cover costs related to a layover if the trip were interrupted.
*   **Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases:** Expenses are reimbursed when a trip is interrupted or terminated early. A layover causing an interruption could fall under this.

**Therefore, a layover would likely qualify for expense coverage if it involves "necessary costs" incurred during the journey or results in an interruption to the planned travel.** The specific expenses covered (e.g., meals, accommodation if the layover is extended) would be reimbursed up to the limits outlined in the Act (lowest travel class for flights, per diem allowances, etc.).

Question: As an official on probation in the preparatory service, do I receive separation allowance?
Answer: According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § , officials on probation in the preparatory service receive a percentage of the compensation provided in paragraph in the case of secondments within the framework of training. This implies they *do* receive some form of allowance related to separation during training secondments, though it's not the full separation allowance described in § .

Additionally, sentence also applies in the case of secondments within the framework of training or induction service. This further reinforces that a form of allowance is provided during training.

Question: Are individuals on probationary status within a preparatory service eligible for a separation allowance?
Answer: According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § , officials on probation in the preparatory service receive a percentage of the compensation provided in paragraph in the case of secondments within the framework of training. This implies they *are* eligible for some form of financial support during secondments for training, which could be related to a separation allowance.

However, § specifically addresses separation allowances for officials and judges seconded *without* a promise of moving expense reimbursement. The text doesn't explicitly state whether probationary officials fall under this category.

Therefore, based *solely* on the provided text, it's not definitively clear if probationary officials are eligible for the *full* separation allowance described in § , but they are eligible for some compensation related to secondments for training as outlined in § .

Question: What is the reason for implementing savings measures like restricted first-class train travel and adjusted per diem reductions?
Answer: According to Explanatory Memorandum A (General Part – Financial Impact), the savings measures – restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains and adjustment of the reduction of the per diem – are implemented to **offset increases in certain compensations** (like mileage allowance and travel cost reimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) **and** to contribute to **savings** overall. Additionally, savings are expected from the **reduction in administrative effort** for travel preparation and settlement.

Question: Could you explain the justification behind changes such as limiting first-class train use and modifying daily allowance amounts?
Answer: The justification for limiting first-class train use and modifying daily allowance amounts stems from a desire for **administrative simplification and cost reduction**. 

Specifically:

*   **First-class train use:** In principle, only second-class train costs will be reimbursed “for reasons of administrative simplification and cost.” The document states that second class is acceptable even for longer distances given current travel comfort, and exceptions require approval from the highest competent authority to foster departmental self-responsibility and flexible handling.
*   **Daily allowance (per diem) adjustments:** The adjustments to the per diem are intended to create **savings** that offset increases in other compensations (like the climate compensation payment for flights and mileage allowance). The adjustments are made "in accordance with tax regulations," implying alignment with existing financial rules to minimize expenditure.

Additionally, the changes are partially offset by savings in other provisions and a reduction in administrative effort for travel preparation and settlement.

Question: reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals in accordance with tax
Answer: The adjustment of the reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals is done “to align with tax regulations” and “eliminates the taxation of parts of the per diem.” Additionally, the percentages for withholding per diem when meals are complimentary are specified in § C (LRKG) – a certain percent for breakfast and a certain percent each for lunch and dinner.

The revised version states the adjustment is done “in line with tax law provisions, thereby eliminating the need to tax parts of the per diem.”

Question: Could you explain the potential changes to personal vehicle mileage reimbursement rates?
Answer: Here's an explanation of the potential changes to personal vehicle mileage reimbursement rates, based solely on the provided text:

Previously, there were three different rates (G, , and cents/km) dependent on engine capacity, compelling reasons for use, and vehicle approval for official travel. Additionally, vehicle ownership (or common household ownership) was a requirement.

The new regulation introduces **only two rates**:

*   **cents/km** – applied when there is a “significant official interest” in using the vehicle. This includes those previously approved for official travel, those carpooling, and severely disabled employees. The previous additional allowance of cents/km for accompanying persons is eliminated.
*   **cents/km** – applied in all other cases of motor vehicle use *and* for the use of other vehicles like bicycles or e-bikes. This rate is meant to cover ongoing operating costs.

**Key changes and simplifications:**

*   The formal “approval of one’s own vehicle for official travel” process is eliminated.
*   The examination of “compelling reasons” for use is no longer necessary.
*   It is no longer required that the traveler owns the vehicle.
*   An incentive is created to use bicycles or e-bikes for shorter trips.

Question: Could you clarify what mileage rate was authorized for official use of a personally owned vehicle that received approval prior to January 1, 2018?
Answer: According to the provided text, prior to January 1, 2018, there were three different rates (G, , and cents/km) depending on engine capacity, compelling reasons for use, and approval for official travel. Specifically, employees who, *under the law in force until December 31, 2017*, fulfilled the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel were eligible for a rate of ** cents/km** if there was a significant official interest in the vehicle's use. 

The text does *not* state the exact values for G, , and , only that they existed previously. However, it *does* state the new rate for vehicles previously approved is cents/km.

Question: What is the mileage reimbursement rate for someone unable to walk due to a leg disability?
Answer: The context doesn't directly state a specific mileage reimbursement rate for someone unable to walk due to a leg disability. However, it does state the following:

*   **§ 2 LRKG:** For official travelers with a disability degree of at least percent, who are normally reimbursed for the lowest class of travel/flight costs, the expenses for the *next higher class* shall be reimbursed.
*   **Explanatory Memorandum B:** ...This includes employees who...as well as other employees when...carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely disabled employees.” which qualifies them for the **higher mileage rate of - cents/km** if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle.

Therefore, a person with a disability qualifying them for a higher travel class, and a significant official interest in using a vehicle, would receive a mileage allowance of **- cents/km**. The exact number of cents is not provided in the context.

Question: Are there established procedures for authorizing the use of personally owned vehicles for work-related trips?
Answer: According to the provided text, previously there was a formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official travel” that involved examining whether compelling reasons existed for its use, and depended on engine capacity. However, **the new regulation eliminates this formal procedure and the examination of compelling reasons.**

Now, there are two rates for using a personal vehicle:

*   **Cents/km** if there is a "significant official interest" in the vehicle's use (including those previously approved for official travel, carpoolers, and severely disabled employees).
*   **Cents/km** in all other cases, intended to cover operating costs.

Critically, **it is no longer required that the traveler uses a vehicle they own** to be eligible for mileage allowance.

Question: Are there changes to the requirements for vehicle ownership and mileage reimbursement for work-related travel?
Answer: Yes, there are significant changes to the requirements for vehicle ownership and mileage reimbursement.

**Previously:**

*   There were three different mileage rates based on engine capacity, compelling reasons for use, and vehicle approval for official travel.
*   The vehicle had to belong to the traveler or someone in their household – a requirement that often caused problems, especially for those in non-marital partnerships.

**Now:**

*   Only two rates apply:
    *   **[Amount] cents/km** if there is a "significant official interest" (including those previously approved for vehicle use, carpoolers, and severely disabled employees).
    *   **[Amount] cents/km** in all other cases *and* for the use of other vehicles like bicycles or e-bikes.
*   **It is no longer required that the traveler uses a vehicle they own** to be eligible for mileage allowance.
*   The formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official travel” and the examination of “compelling reasons” have been eliminated.
