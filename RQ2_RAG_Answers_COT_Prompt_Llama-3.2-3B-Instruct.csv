**Key Facts:**

1. Official trips are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work.
2. The trips must be ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
3. The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically.
4. Official trips include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work.
5. Official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting official business is not possible or reasonable.

**Analyzing the Facts:**

From the key facts, we can infer that an official trip is a journey taken for official business purposes, which requires the approval of the superior. The fact that the trip is outside the usual place of work and involves official business activities suggests that it is not a personal trip.

The requirement for the order or approval from the superior indicates that the trip is not a personal decision, but rather a business-related one. The fact that the order or approval must be in writing or electronically adds to the formal nature of the trip.

The inclusion of journeys from a temporary residence to the place of work further emphasizes the business-related nature of the trip. The condition that the trip should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting official business is not possible or reasonable suggests that the trip is not taken lightly and is intended to achieve specific business objectives.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the key facts and analysis, an official trip is a journey undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which requires the approval of the responsible superior and is not a personal trip. The trip must be taken for business-related purposes and should only be carried out if a less costly method is not possible or reasonable.","Official trips in the sense of this Act are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which have been ordered or approved by the responsible superior, unless an order or approval is not applicable due to the nature of the official’s office or the nature of the official business.

2. The approval must be given in writing or electronically.
3. The regulation mentions that the general administrative regulations for the Act will be issued by the Ministry of Finance.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided, it appears that the approval for official travel can be submitted in electronic form, and there is no requirement for a physical document. However, it is essential to note that the Ministry of Finance may issue regulations that could potentially require or recommend a specific method of submission, but this is not explicitly stated in the Act.

1. **Key Facts:**
   - The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) does not explicitly mention a requirement for a hard copy of the travel authorization.
   - The Act states that the order or approval must be given in writing or electronically.
   - Official trips and errands require written or electronic approval by the responsible superior.
   - Official trips abroad are subject to the provisions of §§  to  mutatis mutandis (with modifications).

2. **Reasoning:**
   - The Act emphasizes the method of approval (written or electronic) rather than the physical medium (hard copy or digital).
   - The requirement for a hard copy is not explicitly stated in the Act, and there's no indication that it's necessary for travel authorization.
   - Given that the Act allows for electronic submission and approval, it's reasonable to infer that a hard copy might not be required, especially in the digital age.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the information provided in the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG), it appears that a hard copy is not required for travel authorization.

meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct,5,"If there is a less expensive method for me to do my job, my official trip can get cancelled?",Original,,Chunk_8,chunk_8; chunk_9; chunk_61; chunk_18; chunk_54; chunk_36; chunk_10; chunk_81; chunk_43; chunk_49,"To determine if an official trip can be cancelled if there is a less expensive method for doing the job, we need to analyze the following key facts:

* Official trips are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which have been ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
* The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically.
* Official trips include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work, provided that the conditions of sentences 1 and 2 are met.
* Official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting the official business is not possible or reasonable.

Now, let's reason through the answer:

1. If there is a less expensive method for doing the job, it means that the official business can be conducted at a lower cost.
2. The official trip was ordered or approved by the responsible superior, which implies that the superior has considered the need for the trip.
3. If a less expensive method is available, it suggests that the superior may not have deemed the trip necessary.
4. However, the Act states that official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method is not possible or reasonable.
5. This implies that the superior must have deemed the trip necessary, even if a less expensive method is available.
6. If the superior has deemed the trip necessary, it is unlikely that the trip would be cancelled solely because a less expensive method is available.
7. However, it is possible that the superior may reconsider the trip if the less expensive method is more cost-effective and still meets the requirements of the job.

Based on this analysis, it is unlikely that an official trip can be cancelled solely because a less expensive method is available. However, it is possible that the superior may reconsider the trip if the less expensive method is more cost-effective and still meets the requirements of the job.

Therefore, the answer is: It is unlikely that an official trip can be cancelled solely because a less expensive method is available, but it is possible that the superior may reconsider the trip if the less expensive method is more cost-effective and still meets the requirements of the job.",Official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting the official business is not possible or reasonable.,COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

1. According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §, an official trip is a journey undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
2. The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically.
3. Official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting the official business is not possible or reasonable.
4. Expenses incurred during an official trip can be reimbursed if the trip is canceled for reasons not attributable to the official traveler.

**Reasoning:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) does not explicitly state that an approved work trip can be rescinded if a cheaper way to complete the necessary tasks becomes available.
2. However, the Act does mention that an official trip should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting the official business is not possible or reasonable (LRKG §).
3. This implies that if a cheaper way to complete the necessary tasks becomes available, it may be considered a less costly method of conducting the official business.
4. Therefore, it can be inferred that if a cheaper way to complete the necessary tasks becomes available, an approved work trip may not be necessary, and the trip may be considered rescinded.

However, the Act does not provide a clear guideline on how to handle such situations. It is likely that the decision to rescind an approved work trip would depend on the specific circumstances and the discretion of the responsible superior.

meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct,7,What is an official errand?,Original,,Chunk_9,chunk_9; chunk_8; chunk_10; chunk_61; chunk_43; chunk_44; chunk_26; chunk_33; chunk_42; chunk_15,"To determine what an official errand is, I'll break down the key facts and reasoning step by step:

**Key Facts:**

2. These journeys must be ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
3. The place of residence is considered equivalent to a temporary residence.
4. Official errands do not include trips for personal purposes.
5. The official business must be conducted outside the usual place of work.

**Step 1: Analyzing the definition of an official errand**

From the provided context, an official errand is a journey undertaken to conduct official business outside the official premises. This implies that the primary purpose of the journey is to perform official duties, rather than for personal reasons.

**Step 2: Considering the requirement of approval**

The fact that the journey must be ordered or approved by the responsible superior indicates that the official errand is subject to oversight and control. This suggests that the errand is not a personal trip, but rather a task assigned by the superior for official purposes.

**Step 3: Excluding personal trips**

The text explicitly states that official errands do not include trips for personal purposes. This further supports the idea that an official errand is a journey undertaken for official business, rather than a personal trip.

**Step 4: Considering the location of the official premises**

The text states that the official premises are the usual place of work or residence. This implies that an official errand is a journey to a location outside these premises, which is necessary for the conduct of official business.

**Step 5: Combining the facts**

Taking into account the key facts and reasoning, an official errand can be defined as a journey undertaken to conduct official business outside the official premises, ordered or approved by the responsible superior, and excluding personal trips.

**Reasoning:**

From the above key fact, we can infer that judges are not required to obtain permission before traveling for official duties if the trip is to conduct judicial duties or participate in a meeting of the presidium or another comparable constitutional body of the court.

However, the Act does not explicitly state that judges are not required to obtain permission for other types of official trips. Therefore, we need to consider the definition of ""official trips"" and ""official errands"" in the Act.

According to the Act, official trips are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which have been ordered or approved by the responsible superior. Official errands are journeys undertaken to conduct official business at the place of work or residence outside the official premises.

However, the Act does not provide clear guidance on whether judges are required to obtain permission for other types of official trips that do not fall under the categories of judicial duties or official errands.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that judges are not required to obtain permission before traveling for official duties if the trip is to conduct judicial duties or participate in a meeting of the presidium or another comparable constitutional body of the court.

**Step 1: Identify the relevant sections of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG)**

* Relevant sections: §  Official Trips and Errands, § Official Trips Abroad, and § Separation Allowance.

**Step 2: Determine the type of official travel**

* According to §  Official Trips and Errands, official trips include journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work.
* According to § Official Trips Abroad, official trips abroad are trips between the domestic territory and foreign countries as well as within foreign countries, with at least one business location abroad.

**Step 3: Consider the specific position of a government commissioner**

* According to the text, government commissioners for data protection and for people with disabilities do not require an order or approval for official trips to perform their duties.
* However, for other government commissioners, an order or approval is required for official trips, unless an exemption applies due to the nature of their office or the nature of the official business.

**Step 4: Analyze the requirements for government-related travel**

* According to § Official Trips and Errands, an order or approval is required for official trips, unless an exemption applies.
* According to § Official Trips Abroad, no specific authorization is mentioned, but it is implied that an order or approval is required for official trips abroad.

2. However, the official superior may designate the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip if the travel route runs immediately past the official premises.
3. If the official trip begins or ends at the official premises, the reimbursement of travel costs shall be based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated as the starting and/or ending point.

* However, the official superior may designate the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip if it is more cost-effective to do so.
* If the official trip begins or ends at the official premises, the reimbursement of travel costs is based on the distance from or to the residence, which implies that you still have some flexibility in choosing the starting and/or ending point.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG), you are generally free to choose the starting point of the trip, as it is determined by the principle of cost-effectiveness. However, the official superior may designate the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip if it is more cost-effective to do so.","The starting and ending points of an official trip are generally to be determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness.

1. **General rule**: According to §  (Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement), the starting and ending points of an official trip are generally determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness.

2. **Deviation from the general rule**: The official superior may deviate from this general rule if the travel route runs immediately past the official premises.

3. **Special cases**: 
   - If the official trip is commenced and/or concluded at the traveler's residence, the reimbursement of travel costs (or mileage allowance) shall be based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated as the starting and/or ending point.
   - In the case of an official trip that is commenced and/or concluded at the traveler's residence, the one nearest to the official premises shall be decisive.

4. **Official trips abroad**: According to § (Official Trips Abroad), the country is deemed reached at the time the airplane lands there, and stopovers are disregarded unless they necessitate an overnight stay.

5. **Per diem allowance**: The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises or the beginning and/or end has been ordered at the official premises.

6. **Special cases**: 
   - If it is ordered or approved that the official trip is to commence or conclude at the vacation location, the travel expense reimbursement shall be calculated based on the departure from or arrival at that location.
   - If the stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days, the reimbursement is granted as would be provided in the case of a secondment.

7. **Official trips and errands**: Official trips in the sense of this Act are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which have been ordered or approved by the responsible superior.

Based on the information above, the trip's beginning and ending locations can be flexible in the following situations:

- If the travel route runs immediately past the official premises.
- If the official trip is commenced and/or concluded at the traveler's residence, as long as the one nearest to the official premises is chosen.
- If the official trip is ordered or approved to commence or conclude at the vacation location.
- If the stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days.

However, the beginning and ending locations are not flexible in other situations, such as:

- If the official trip begins or ends at the official premises.
- If the official trip is not commenced or concluded at the traveler's residence.

Therefore, the trip's beginning and ending locations can be flexible in some cases, but not in all cases.","The starting and ending points of an official trip are generally to be determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to §  Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement, the starting and ending points of an official trip are generally determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness.
2. However, if the travel route runs immediately past the official premises, the official superior may designate the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip.
3. In the case of an official trip that is commenced and/or concluded at the traveler's residence, the reimbursement of travel costs shall be based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated as the starting and/or ending point.

**Reasoning:**

Given that the official trip begins or ends at the traveler's residence, we need to consider the exceptions to the general principle of cost-effectiveness.

According to § Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement, if the official trip is commenced and/or concluded at the traveler's residence, the reimbursement of travel costs shall be based on the distance from or to the residence.

However, this exception only applies if the official premises have not been designated as the starting and/or ending point of the trip. If the travel route runs immediately past the official premises, the official superior may designate the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip.

Since we do not have any information about the travel route or the official superior's designation of the official premises, we can conclude that the travel cost reimbursement will be based on the distance from or to the residence, as per § Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement.

Therefore, the answer is: The travel cost reimbursement will be calculated based on the distance from or to the residence.","In case of an official trip that is commenced and/or concluded at the traveler’s residence, the reimbursement of travel costs (§ 4) or the mileage allowance (§ 5) shall be based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated as the starting and/or ending point.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

1. Official trips are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
2. Official trips include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work.
3. Official trips also include journeys from the place of work to a location serving as a temporary residence.
4. The official superior must give the order or approval in writing or electronically.
5. Official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting official business is not possible or reasonable.
6. Official errands are journeys undertaken to conduct official business at the place of work or residence outside the official premises.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Definition of Official Trips and Errands**: According to the State Travel Expense Act, official trips and errands are journeys undertaken to conduct official business. These can be undertaken at the place of work or residence, or outside the official premises.
2. **Location of Official Trips**: Official trips can start and end at a location serving as a temporary residence or the place of work, unless an order or approval is not applicable due to the nature of the official's office or the nature of the official business.
3. **Travel Expenses**: According to the Act, travel expenses for official trips and errands are reimbursed to an appropriate extent.
4. **Reimbursement for Travel Expenses**: The reimbursement of travel expenses is generally determined by the principle of cost-effectiveness. However, the official superior may deviate from this principle if the travel route runs immediately past the official premises.
5. **Accommodations and Mileage Allowance**: When official trips commence and/or conclude at the traveler's residence, the reimbursement of travel costs (or mileage allowance) shall be based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated as the starting and/or ending point.

**Conclusion:**

When official travel doesn't start and stop at the normal work location, travel expenses can be covered in the following scenarios:

- If the official trip starts and ends at the place of work, travel expenses are reimbursed based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated as the starting and/or ending point.
- If the official trip starts and ends at a location serving as a temporary residence, travel expenses are reimbursed based on the distance from or to the residence.
- If the official trip is canceled for reasons not attributable to the official traveler, necessary expenses incurred in preparation are reimbursed.
- If official travelers fall ill and are admitted to a hospital, necessary expenses for accommodation at the business location are reimbursed for each full calendar day of the hospital stay.

In summary, travel expenses for official trips and errands can be covered when they start and end at a location other than the normal work location, as long as the official superior has given the necessary order or approval and the expenses are incurred in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness.","In case of an official trip that is commenced and/or concluded at the traveler’s residence, the reimbursement of travel costs (§ 4) or the mileage allowance (§ 5) shall be based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises have been designated as the starting and/or ending point.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

1. The travel expense reimbursement expires if it is not applied for in writing or electronically within a limitation period of six months after the end of the official trip.
2. The period begins the day after the end of the trip.
3. In cases where an official trip would have ended, the period ends on that day.

Now, let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. The period of six months starts on the day after the end of the official trip.
2. To find the deadline for the entitlement to travel expense reimbursement, we need to add six months to the day after the end of the trip.
3. Since the period begins on the day after the end of the trip, we can assume that the end of the trip is the reference point.
4. Adding six months to the day after the end of the trip, we get: day after the end of the trip + 6 months = 7 months after the end of the trip.
5. However, the text states that the period ends on the day the trip would have ended, which means that the actual deadline for the entitlement to travel expense reimbursement is the day the trip would have ended, not 7 months after the end of the trip.
6. Therefore, the deadline for the entitlement to travel expense reimbursement is the day the trip would have ended, which is 6 months after the end of the trip.

However, we must also consider the general rule that the period begins the day after the end of the trip. Therefore, the correct deadline for the entitlement to travel expense reimbursement is the day the trip would have ended, plus one day (the day after the end of the trip), which equals 7 months after the end of the trip.",The entitlement to travel expense reimbursement expires if it is not applied for in writing or electronically within a limitation period of six months after the end of the official trip.,COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

1. The Travel Expense Act (LRKG) states that the entitlement to travel expense reimbursement expires if it is not applied for in writing or electronically within a limitation period of six months after the end of the official trip.
2. The period begins the day after the end of the trip.
3. The competent authorities may require the submission of relevant cost receipts up to six months after the application.
4. If receipts are not submitted within one month upon request, the reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent.
5. The official traveler is obliged to keep the cost receipts for one year after the reimbursement for purposes of audit and to present them upon request.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the key facts, we can conclude that the last date to submit a request for travel expense reimbursement is six months after the end of the official trip. This is explicitly stated in the Travel Expense Act (LRKG) as the limitation period for submitting a request for reimbursement.

Additionally, the fact that the period begins the day after the end of the trip further supports this conclusion, as it implies that the six-month limitation period starts immediately after the trip has ended.

The fact that the competent authorities may require the submission of receipts up to six months after the application does not change the fact that the initial six-month limitation period for submitting a request for reimbursement is the most relevant deadline.

3. There is no specific mention of the start date of the six-month window.

Based on these facts, the start date of the six-month window for submitting travel expense reimbursements is the day after the official trip ends.

To break it down step by step:

1. Identify the key fact: The six-month window starts from the day after the end of the official trip.
2. Understand the rule: The period begins the day after the end of the trip.
3. Apply the rule to the given situation: Since the six-month window starts from the day after the official trip ends, we need to determine when the trip ends to establish the start date of the window.
4. Reasoning: Unfortunately, the provided text does not explicitly state the end date of the trip. However, it does mention that if the trip would have ended on a certain date, the period ends on that date (e.g., in cases under §). This suggests that the end date of the trip is not explicitly stated, but it implies that the period starts from the day after the trip ends.
5. Conclusion: Since the text does not provide a clear end date for the trip, we cannot determine the exact start date of the six-month window based solely on the provided information.

1. The entitlement to travel expense reimbursement expires if it is not applied for in writing or electronically within a limitation period of six months after the end of the official trip.
2. The period begins the day after the end of the trip; in cases under §(), it ends on the day the trip would have ended.

4. If these receipts are not submitted within one month upon request, the reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent.
5. The official traveler is obliged to keep the cost receipts for one year after the reimbursement for purposes of audit and to present them upon request.
6. Reimbursement of travel expenses and expenses incurred may be waived in whole or in part, and such a waiver must be declared in writing or electronically.

**Analysis:**

Based on these key facts, we can conclude that the submission of receipts is not explicitly required for the travel expense reimbursement application. The text states that the competent authorities may require the submission of receipts up to six months after the application, but this is not a strict requirement. Additionally, the official traveler is not obliged to submit receipts upon application, but rather is required to keep them for one year after reimbursement.

The text also states that if receipts are not submitted within one month upon request, the reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent. However, this is a consequence of not submitting the receipts, not a requirement to submit them.

Therefore, the submission of receipts is not a mandatory requirement for the travel expense reimbursement application, but rather a voluntary action that may be requested by the competent authorities.

**Reasoning:**

1. The Act explicitly states that the entitlement to travel expense reimbursement expires if it is not applied for within six months after the end of the official trip.
2. This implies that the application needs to be accompanied by supporting documentation, such as receipts, to establish the legitimacy of the expenses incurred.
3. The requirement to submit receipts is not limited to the initial application, but also extends to the submission of relevant cost receipts up to six months after the application.
4. If receipts are not submitted within one month upon request, the reimbursement application may be rejected, indicating that the submission of receipts is a necessary condition for processing the application.

1. The Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement expires if not applied for in writing or electronically within a limitation period of six months after the end of the official trip.
2. The period begins the day after the end of the trip.
3. The competent authorities may require the submission of relevant cost receipts up to six months after the application.
4. If receipts are not submitted within one month upon request, the reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent.
5. The official traveler is obliged to keep the cost receipts for one year after reimbursement for purposes of audit and to present them upon request.

Based on these facts, the deadline for submitting payment receipts can be broken down as follows:

- The period starts on the day after the end of the trip, which means the deadline for submitting receipts is at least 1 day after the trip ends.
- The Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement expires 6 months after the end of the trip, which means the deadline for submitting receipts is at most 6 months after the trip ends.
- However, the competent authorities may require receipts up to 6 months after the application, but the official traveler is obliged to keep receipts for 1 year after reimbursement.
- The application for reimbursement must be submitted within a reasonable time after the trip, but the exact deadline is not specified.

Considering these points, it can be inferred that the deadline for submitting payment receipts is within 6 months after the end of the trip, but the exact deadline may vary depending on the competent authorities' requirements.","If these receipts are not submitted within one month upon request, the reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

   - The period begins the day after the end of the trip.
   - The competent authorities may require submission of cost receipts up to 6 months after the application.
   - If receipts are not submitted within 1 month upon request, the reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent.
   - The official traveler must keep cost receipts for 1 year after reimbursement for audit purposes.

2. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The key point here is the ""6 months after the end of the official trip"" mentioned in the entitlement to travel expense reimbursement section.
   - This means the clock starts ticking from the day after the official trip ends.
   - The period for submitting proof of payment or receipts is within this 6-month window.
   - The text does not explicitly state a deadline for submitting proof of payment, but it implies that the application for reimbursement must be submitted within the 6-month window.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the 6-month period starts the day after the official trip ends, the last day to turn in proof of payment or receipts would be 5 months and 23 days after the end of the trip.

However, the information does not explicitly state the last day to turn in proof of payment. The text focuses on the application deadline for reimbursement, not the submission deadline for receipts.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §, the official traveler is obliged to keep the cost receipts for one year after the reimbursement for purposes of audit and to present them upon request.
2. The Act states that if the receipts are not submitted within one month upon request, the reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the key facts, it is clear that the official traveler is required to keep the receipts for a period of one year after the reimbursement. This implies that the receipts should be retained as evidence and not discarded until the one-year period has elapsed.

Throwing away the receipts before the one-year period would mean that the official traveler is not complying with the requirement to keep the receipts for audit purposes. This could potentially lead to issues with the reimbursement application and may result in rejection of the application to that extent.

Therefore, it is not recommended to throw away the receipts after submitting them. Instead, they should be retained for the required one-year period.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §, it is not advisable to throw away your receipts after submitting them.

**Step 1: Identify key facts**

* The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) sets a limitation period of six months for submitting receipts after the end of an official trip.
* The competent authorities may require the submission of cost receipts up to six months after the application.
* If receipts are not submitted within one month upon request, the reimbursement application may be rejected to that extent.
* The official traveler is obliged to keep the cost receipts for one year after reimbursement for audit purposes.

**Step 2: Analyze the context**

The context suggests that receipts are submitted to support a reimbursement claim, and the competent authorities may request their submission at any time within the six-month period. However, it does not explicitly state that the official traveler can discard the receipts once they have been submitted.

**Step 3: Determine the answer**

Based on the analysis, it appears that the official traveler is not allowed to discard receipts once they have been submitted. The fact that the competent authorities may require the submission of receipts up to six months after the application suggests that the receipts remain relevant for a period of time after submission.

The only provision that mentions keeping receipts for audit purposes is in section (LRKG § ), which states that the official traveler must keep the cost receipts for one year after reimbursement. However, this provision does not imply that the traveler can discard the receipts once they have been submitted.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §, the waiver of travel expense reimbursement and reimbursement of expenses must be declared in writing or electronically.
2. The Act states that the waiver must be declared in writing or electronically, but it does not specify whether it is possible to submit a waiver electronically.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. The Act requires that a waiver must be declared in writing or electronically (LRKG §). This suggests that electronic submission is an option.
2. The text does not explicitly state that electronic submission is the only option, but it does state that a waiver must be declared in writing or electronically, implying that electronic submission is acceptable.
3. The Act does not provide any information about the technical requirements or procedures for electronic submission, but it does not mention any restrictions on electronic submission either.
4. Considering the general context of the Act, which is focused on updating and simplifying administrative procedures, it is reasonable to assume that electronic submission is a viable option.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided, it appears that you can submit a waiver electronically. The Act does not explicitly state that electronic submission is the only option, but it does state that a waiver must be declared in writing or electronically.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG), official travelers who receive benefits from third parties on the occasion of an official trip can credit these benefits against their travel expense reimbursement.
2. However, for official trips undertaken for a secondary activity performed at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority, the traveler can only be reimbursed to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.
3. The State Travel Expense Act regulates the reimbursement of expenses for official trips, official errands, and trips for the purpose of education or training for state officials, judges in state service, and officials of municipalities, counties, and other bodies under state supervision.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. If you receive benefits from third parties on the occasion of an official trip, you can credit these benefits against your travel expense reimbursement. This means that you can subtract the amount of the benefits from the total travel expense reimbursement.
2. However, if the benefits are for a secondary activity performed at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority, the reimbursement is only allowed to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip. This means that you can only credit the benefits against your travel expense reimbursement if no other body is providing reimbursement for the same trip.
3. Since the State Travel Expense Act regulates the reimbursement of expenses for official trips, official errands, and trips for the purpose of education or training, this Act applies to your situation.
4. Therefore, if you receive benefits from third parties on the occasion of an official trip, you can credit these benefits against your travel expense reimbursement, but only to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.

**Conclusion:**

Receiving benefits from third parties on the occasion of an official trip can affect your travel expense reimbursement in the following way:

* You can credit the benefits against your travel expense reimbursement.
* However, if the benefits are for a secondary activity performed at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority, you can only credit the benefits against your travel expense reimbursement to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to §  Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement, official travelers can receive reimbursement for necessary additional expenses incurred due to official travel.
2. Benefits received from third parties on the occasion of an official trip can be credited against travel expense reimbursement (§ Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement).
3. The travel expense reimbursement includes various costs such as travel and flight costs, mileage allowance, per diem allowance, accommodation allowance, and other costs (§ Scope).
4. Expenses incurred during an extended stay at a business location can be reimbursed (§ Scope).
5. Reimbursement of expenses incurred during an early termination of a vacation or private trip is possible (§ Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases).

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Step 1: Determine if the benefit is related to official travel**: If the outside benefit is related to the official trip, such as a free accommodation or meal, it can be credited against travel expense reimbursement (§ Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement).
2. **Step 2: Check if the benefit is reimbursable under the Act**: If the benefit is not reimbursable under the Act, it may still be reimbursed as incidental expenses (§ Reimbursement of Other Costs).
3. **Step 3: Consider the impact on travel expense reimbursement**: If the benefit is related to the official trip, it will be subtracted from the total travel expense reimbursement. If the benefit is not reimbursable under the Act, it will be reimbursed as incidental expenses.
4. **Step 4: Determine if the benefit is taxable**: If the benefit is taxable, it may be subject to taxation and may not be fully reimbursable.
5. **Step 5: Consider any additional requirements or limitations**: Certain benefits, such as reimbursement of expenses incurred during an extended stay at a business location, may require additional documentation or have specific requirements.

**Conclusion:**

Outside benefits can impact the process of getting reimbursed for travel costs under the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) in several ways:

* Benefits received from third parties can be credited against travel expense reimbursement.
* Benefits not reimbursable under the Act may be reimbursed as incidental expenses.
* Taxation of benefits may affect the amount of reimbursement.
* Certain benefits may require additional documentation or have specific requirements.

1. **The trip was undertaken for a secondary activity**: This means the primary purpose of the trip was not official business, but rather a personal or private activity.
2. **The trip was undertaken at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority**: This indicates that the trip was initiated or approved by your employer or a government agency.
3. **You are an official traveler**: This means you are a state official, judge, or official of a municipality, county, or institution under state supervision, and you are entitled to travel expense reimbursement.

Now, let's apply these facts to the relevant sections of the State Travel Expense Act:

* LRKG §  Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement states that official travelers are entitled to reimbursement for official trips only if no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.
* Since the trip was undertaken for a secondary activity, we need to consider whether the competent authority's request or suggestion implies that the trip is also for official business.
* LRKG §  Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases states that if an official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip, the travel expense reimbursement shall be calculated as if only the official trip were undertaken.
* However, this section does not explicitly address trips undertaken for secondary activities.

Now, let's examine the relevant sections again:

* LRKG §  Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement states that official travelers shall only be entitled to reimbursement to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.
* Since the trip was undertaken for a secondary activity, it is likely that another body (e.g., your private health insurance) may provide reimbursement for the trip.
* Therefore, you are not entitled to travel expense reimbursement for the entire trip, as another body provides reimbursement for the same trip.

**Conclusion**: Based on the State Travel Expense Act, you are not entitled to travel expense reimbursement for the entire trip, as another body (your private health insurance) provides reimbursement for the same trip. However, you may still be entitled to reimbursement for official expenses incurred during the trip that are not reimbursed by the other body.","For official trips undertaken for a secondary activity, which is performed at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority, travelers shall only be entitled to reimbursement under this Act to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.

**Key Facts:**

1. Official trips are defined in the Act as journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
2. The Act states that official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting official business is not possible or reasonable.
3. Expenses incurred for official trips are reimbursed according to the Act.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. According to §  (Official Trips), official trips are defined as journeys to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
2. However, the Act does not explicitly state that official trips must be primarily for work-related purposes.
3. Section  (Reimbursement of Travel and Flight Costs) states that necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport shall be reimbursed up to the cost of the lowest travel class.
4. However, this section does not specify that travel costs are only reimbursed for official trips.
5. Section  (Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement) states that official travelers shall receive reimbursement for necessary additional expenses incurred due to official travel, but it does not specify that travel costs must be for official purposes.
6. Section  (Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases) states that if an official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip, the travel expense reimbursement shall be calculated as if only the official trip were undertaken.
7. This suggests that the Act allows for some flexibility in reimbursing travel costs, even if the trip is not primarily for work-related purposes.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, it appears that travel costs may be covered under the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) even if the trip is primarily for something other than work. However, it is essential to note that the Act's primary focus is on reimbursing expenses incurred for official business. If the trip is not primarily for work-related purposes, the reimbursement may be subject to certain conditions or limitations.

To determine whether travel costs are covered, the following factors should be considered:

* The purpose of the trip
* The level of approval and oversight by the responsible superior
* The nature of the official business or activities undertaken during the trip
* The extent to which the trip is related to official duties and responsibilities

Ultimately, the decision to reimburse travel costs will depend on the specific circumstances of each case and the discretion of the relevant authorities.","For official trips undertaken for a secondary activity, which is performed at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority, travelers shall only be entitled to reimbursement under this Act to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §, travelers may waive all or part of the travel expense reimbursement and reimbursement of expenses in writing or electronically.
2. For official trips undertaken for a secondary activity, travelers are entitled to reimbursement under this Act only if no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.
3. If official trips are canceled for reasons not attributable to the official traveler, the necessary expenses incurred in preparation are reimbursed.
4. Official travelers are entitled to reimbursement for travel and flight costs of the lowest class if they have a disability degree of at least 50%.
5. The travel expense reimbursement includes various types of expenses such as mileage allowance, per diem allowance, accommodation allowance, and reimbursement of other costs.

**Reasoning:**

To answer the question, we need to analyze the provisions related to waiver of reimbursement and entitlement to reimbursement under this regulation.

The relevant provisions are:

* State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §: ""The traveler may waive all or part of the travel expense reimbursement and reimbursement of expenses. Such a waiver must be declared in writing or electronically.""
* State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §: ""For official trips undertaken for a secondary activity, which is performed at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority, travelers shall only be entitled to reimbursement under this Act to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.""

From these provisions, it can be inferred that if a traveler waives their right to reimbursement from another organization, it does not necessarily mean that they are not entitled to reimbursement under this regulation. The waiver only applies to reimbursement from that specific organization.

However, the provision ""For official trips undertaken for a secondary activity, which is performed at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority, travelers shall only be entitled to reimbursement under this Act to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip"" suggests that if another organization provides reimbursement for the same trip, the traveler is not entitled to reimbursement under this regulation.

Therefore, if you waive your right to reimbursement from another organization, you may still be entitled to reimbursement under this regulation, but only to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.

In other words, the waiver from one organization does not necessarily mean that you are not entitled to reimbursement from this regulation, but it may affect your entitlement to reimbursement from other organizations.","For official trips undertaken for a secondary activity, which is performed at the request, suggestion, or instigation of the competent authority, travelers shall only be entitled to reimbursement under this Act to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.

**Step 1: Identify key facts**

* The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) regulates travel expense reimbursement for official trips.
* The Act states that travelers are only entitled to reimbursement if no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.
* The Act allows for reimbursement of various expenses, including travel and flight costs, mileage allowance, per diem allowance, accommodation allowance, and other costs.

**Step 2: Analyze the relevant provisions**

* Section LRKG § Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement states that travelers are entitled to reimbursement only if no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.
* Section LRKG § Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases states that if an official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip, the travel expense reimbursement shall be calculated as if only the official trip were undertaken.

**Step 3: Apply the provisions to the scenario**

* If you choose not to seek payment from a different entity, it means that you are not claiming reimbursement from that entity.
* However, this does not necessarily affect your eligibility for reimbursement under the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG).
* The Act's provision on reimbursement only applies if no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.
* If you are not claiming reimbursement from the other entity, it means that you are not relying on their coverage, and therefore, the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) becomes the primary source of coverage.

**Step 4: Draw a conclusion**

* Based on the analysis, choosing not to seek payment from a different entity does not affect your eligibility for reimbursement under the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG).
* The Act's provision on reimbursement only applies if no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip, and since you are not relying on their coverage, the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) becomes the primary source of coverage.
* Therefore, you are still eligible for reimbursement under the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG), and the other entity's refusal to pay would not be considered your primary coverage.

2. For official trips undertaken for a secondary activity, travelers are entitled to reimbursement only if no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.

5. The entitlement to travel expense reimbursement expires if it is not applied for in writing or electronically within a six-month limitation period after the end of the official trip.

**Reasoning:**

To partially waive travel expense reimbursement, you would need to declare it in writing or electronically. However, the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) does not explicitly state that partial waivers are allowed.

From the provided context, it seems that the Act allows for the waiver of travel expense reimbursement in whole or part, but only if declared in writing or electronically. This implies that a partial waiver is possible, but it must be explicitly stated in writing or electronically.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §, the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority may grant a lump sum reimbursement in lieu of individual travel expense reimbursements.
2. The lump sum reimbursement is based on the average of individual reimbursements incurred in a certain period.
3. For trips for the purpose of education or training that are partially in the official interest, costs incurred up to the amount of the travel expense reimbursement to which one is entitled for official trips may be reimbursed with the consent of the highest competent authority or its authorized authority.
4. Expenses may only be reimbursed up to a certain percentage (not specified) for officials in certain cases.
5. The highest competent authority may refrain from reducing reimbursement if there are special official reasons.
6. Travelers may waive all or part of the travel expense reimbursement and reimbursement of expenses in writing or electronically.
7. The travel expense reimbursement for official trips undertaken for a secondary activity is limited to the extent that no other body provides reimbursement for the same trip.

**Reasoning:**

Based on these key facts, we can conclude that:

* The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) does not explicitly state that travelers can accept less than the full amount for their travel costs.
* However, it does provide flexibility in reimbursement options, such as lump sum reimbursement, waiver of reimbursement, and exceptions to reimbursement rates.
* For certain types of trips, such as education or training trips, costs incurred up to the reimbursement amount may be reimbursed with the consent of the highest competent authority.
* The Act also allows for exceptions to reimbursement rates, such as for officials with special reasons or for certain expenses.

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) states that necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport shall be reimbursed up to the cost of the lowest travel class.
2. The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority may permit exceptions for its area of responsibility.
3. Flight costs are reimbursable if the official or economic reasons for using air travel outweigh the climate protection considerations.

**Analysis:**

1. According to the key fact, necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport are reimbursable up to the cost of the lowest travel class. This implies that using regular public transport is a valid option for reimbursement.
2. However, there is a condition: the costs must be necessary for the journey. If the journey is not necessary, reimbursement may not be granted.
3. The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority may permit exceptions for its area of responsibility. This means that if there are exceptional circumstances that justify the use of a higher class of travel, reimbursement may be granted.
4. Flight costs are reimbursable if the official or economic reasons for using air travel outweigh the climate protection considerations. This suggests that using air travel may be justified in certain situations, but it is not a default option.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided, using regular public transport is a valid option for reimbursement, as long as the costs are necessary for the journey. If the journey is not necessary, reimbursement may not be granted.

2. The text states that travel costs will not be reimbursed if a complimentary mode of transport is available.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the key facts, we can infer that public transportation is considered a complimentary mode of transport in this context. This is because the State Travel Expense Act explicitly states that travel costs will not be reimbursed if a complimentary mode of transport is available.

Therefore, if an official traveler chooses to use public transportation, which is a complimentary mode of transport, their expenses for typical public transportation will not be reimbursable.

2. Official travelers who do not have a disability degree of at least 40% may be reimbursed for the expenses of the next higher class if their physical or health condition justifies it.
3. The reimbursement is only granted with the consent of the highest competent authority or its authorized authority.
4. For trips for the purpose of education or training that are partially in the official interest, costs incurred up to the amount of the travel expense reimbursement to which one is entitled for official trips may be reimbursed with the consent of the highest competent authority or its authorized authority.
5. Expenses may only be reimbursed up to 90% for such trips.
6. The highest competent authority may refrain from the reduction under sentence  for its area of responsibility if there are special official reasons.

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: Identify key facts**

* The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) regulates the reimbursement of expenses for official trips and official errands.
* Official trips are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which have been ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
* Official errands are journeys undertaken to conduct official business at the place of work or residence outside the official premises.
* Travel expense reimbursement is allowed for official travelers, judges in state service, and officials of municipalities, counties, and other bodies under state supervision.
* Expenses incurred during official trips and official errands can be reimbursed, and the reimbursement is subject to certain conditions.

**Step 2: Analyze the relevant provisions**

* Section  (Official Trips and Errands) states that official trips and errands are allowed if they have been ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
* Section  (Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases) allows for reimbursement of travel expenses up to  percent for trips for the purpose of education or training that are partially in the official interest.
* Section  (Reimbursement of Travel and Flight Costs) states that official travelers who have a disability degree of at least  percent may be reimbursed for travel or flight costs of the next higher class.
* Section  (Scope) states that this Act regulates the reimbursement of expenses for official trips and official errands, as well as for trips for the purpose of education or training.

**Step 3: Identify situations that allow for approval of travel expenses beyond the standard class**

Based on the analysis, the following situations allow for approval of travel expenses beyond the standard class:

1. **Trips for the purpose of education or training**: According to Section , officials may be reimbursed for travel expenses up to  percent for trips that are partially in the official interest.
2. **Trips for officials with a disability degree of at least  percent**: According to Section , officials with a disability degree of at least  percent may be reimbursed for travel or flight costs of the next higher class.
3. **Official trips by judges to carry out judicial duties or to participate in a meeting of the presidium or another comparable constitutional body of the court**: According to Section , no order or approval is required for these trips.
4. **Official trips by the state commissioner for data protection to perform his or her duties under the State Data Protection Act**: According to Section , no order or approval is required for these trips.
5. **Official trips by the government commissioner for the concerns of people with disabilities to perform his or her duties under the State Equal Opportunities for People with Disabilities Act**: According to Section , no order or approval is required for these trips.

In summary, these situations allow for approval of travel expenses beyond the standard class, as they are exempt from the usual requirements or have special provisions that permit reimbursement at a higher level.","If official travelers have a disability degree of at least 50 percent, the expenses for the next higher class shall be reimbursed.

1. The first sentence of § states that if a rental car or taxi is used, the necessary costs incurred shall be reimbursed. This suggests that the cost of a rental car or taxi is indeed reimbursable.
2. The phrase ""necessary costs incurred"" implies that the cost of a rental car or taxi must be directly related to an official purpose or need, such as a business trip or official event.
3. The second sentence of § states that if no compelling reason exists, no higher travel expense reimbursement may be granted than when using public transport. This implies that a rental car or taxi is only reimbursed if it is necessary, not just for convenience or personal reasons.
4. Since the question does not specify a compelling reason, we can infer that the cost of a rental car or taxi would not be reimbursed if it is not directly related to an official purpose.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §, the cost of a rental car or taxi is reimbursed if a compelling reason exists. If no compelling reason is present, the reimbursement is contingent on the cost of public transport. Therefore, the answer is: **Yes, the cost of a rental car or taxi is reimbursed if a compelling reason exists.**","If, for a compelling reason, a rental car or taxi is used, the necessary costs incurred shall be reimbursed.

1. **Identify key facts:**
   - The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) does not explicitly mention ""rental car"" or ""taxi"" separately.
   - It does mention ""rental car"" in the context of reimbursing necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport (§ LRKG §  Reimbursement of Travel and Flight Costs).
   - It does not mention ""taxi"" separately, but it does mention ""necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport.""

2. **Reasoning through the answer:**
   - The Act focuses on reimbursing necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport (e.g., buses, trains, trams).
   - The reimbursement of rental car or taxi expenses is not explicitly stated as a separate category.
   - However, the Act does mention that if a rental car or taxi is used, the necessary costs incurred shall be reimbursed if there is a compelling reason for its use (§ LRKG §  Reimbursement of Travel and Flight Costs).
   - Since the Act does not provide a clear distinction between ""rental car"" and ""taxi,"" we need to consider the broader context.
   - Given that both rental cars and taxis are forms of private transportation, and considering the Act's focus on reimbursing necessary costs for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport, it is reasonable to infer that rental car or taxi expenses would be covered if they are deemed necessary for an official journey and are not reimbursed as part of the public transport costs.

**Conclusion:**
Rental car or taxi expenses are covered under the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) if there is a compelling reason for their use, and they are reimbursed in conjunction with necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport.","If, for a compelling reason, a rental car or taxi is used, the necessary costs incurred shall be reimbursed.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §, a surcharge may be granted for the mileage allowance if, due to the nature of the official business, journeys on unpaved roads or difficult-to-drive field or forest tracks are regularly required.
2. The surcharge amounts to cents per kilometer.

**Reasoning:**

To calculate the surcharge for mileage allowance in case of difficult roads, we need to identify the rate per kilometer and the type of road.

1. The base rate for mileage allowance is cents per kilometer.
2. Since the surcharge is granted for journeys on unpaved roads or difficult-to-drive field or forest tracks, we need to determine the specific rate for these types of roads.
3. According to the text, the surcharge rate is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that it is equal to the base rate (cents per kilometer).

**Conclusion:**

Since the surcharge rate is equal to the base rate (cents per kilometer), and the base rate is not explicitly stated, we can infer that the surcharge for mileage allowance in case of difficult roads is also cents per kilometer.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §, if there is a significant official interest in the use of a motor vehicle, the mileage allowance is granted at a rate of cents per kilometer traveled.
2. However, if the journey requires journeys on unpaved roads or difficult-to-drive field or forest tracks, a surcharge may be granted for the mileage allowance.
3. The surcharge amount is not explicitly stated in the text, but it is mentioned that it is cents per kilometer.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the provided information, it appears that the surcharge is a separate rate applied to the mileage allowance when driving on challenging roads. Since the surcharge amount is not explicitly stated, we can infer that it is likely to be a fixed amount per kilometer.

To determine the extra cost added to mileage reimbursement when driving on challenging roads, we need to consider the following:

* The original mileage allowance rate is cents per kilometer.
* A surcharge is applied to this rate for journeys on challenging roads.

Let's assume the surcharge is x cents per kilometer. Then, the total cost of driving on challenging roads would be:

Original mileage allowance rate + Surcharge (x cents/km) = cents/km

For example, if the original mileage allowance rate is 100 cents/km and the surcharge is 20 cents/km, the total cost would be:

100 cents/km + 20 cents/km = 120 cents/km

Therefore, the extra cost added to mileage reimbursement when driving on challenging roads would be the surcharge amount (20 cents/km in this example).

**Key Facts:**

1. The per diem allowance is granted for each full calendar day of an official trip.
2. The amount of the per diem allowance varies depending on the duration of the trip.
3. For a full calendar day, the per diem allowance is €  for a duration of more than  hours, and €  for a duration of more than  hours.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. We are asked to determine the per diem allowance for a full calendar day of an official trip.
2. Since the trip is a full calendar day, we can apply the general rule for full calendar days.
3. According to the text, for a full calendar day, the per diem allowance is €  for a duration of more than  hours, and €  for a duration of more than  hours.
4. Since the duration of the trip is not specified, we cannot determine which of the two amounts to use. However, we can conclude that the per diem allowance for a full calendar day is at least €  for a duration of more than  hours.
5. However, since the duration of the trip is not specified, we cannot determine the exact amount of the per diem allowance for a full calendar day.

**Answer:**

Key facts:

- The per diem allowance is granted for each full calendar day of an official trip.
- For an official trip lasting more than 8 hours, the per diem allowance is  euros.
- There is no specific mention of a daily allowance for a full 24-hour period.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The per diem allowance is granted for each full calendar day of an official trip.
2. Since the question asks for the allowance for a complete 24-hour period, we need to determine if 24 hours falls into the category of more than 8 hours.
3. According to the text, the per diem allowance is  euros for an official trip lasting more than 8 hours.
4. Since 24 hours is indeed more than 8 hours, the per diem allowance for the complete 24-hour period is  euros.

Therefore, the daily allowance amount in euros for an official trip covering a complete 24-hour period is  euros.","For each full calendar day of an official trip, a per diem allowance of 24 euros is granted to compensate for additional expenses for meals.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

2. The per diem allowance for the day of departure is €  for a duration of more than  hours, and €  for a duration of more than  hours.
3. The per diem allowance for the day of return is the same as the per diem allowance for the day of departure.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. Since the official trip is lasting less than one full calendar day, we need to consider the per diem allowance for the day of departure.
2. The duration of the trip is not specified, so we need to consider the maximum duration for the per diem allowance, which is  hours.
3. Since the trip is lasting less than one full calendar day, we need to consider the maximum duration of  hours.
4. Therefore, the per diem allowance for the day of departure is €.

**Key Facts:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance states that if official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, a certain percentage of the per diem for breakfast and meals shall be withheld from the entitled per diem.
2. The percentages for the withheld per diem are 25% for breakfast and 25% for lunch and dinner.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance does not explicitly state a daily expense rate for business travel that doesn't span a complete 24-hour period.
2. However, we can infer that the per diem rate is applicable to official trips, and the percentages mentioned in the relevant section (25% for breakfast and 25% for lunch and dinner) are likely to be applied to the per diem for the entire day.
3. Since the per diem is not explicitly defined in the relevant section, we need to consider the general provisions of the State Travel Expense Act.
4. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § G Reimbursement of Expenses for an Extended Stay at the Business Location states that for longer official trips and secondments, the actual necessary accommodation costs and, for the first three months, a lump sum to compensate for additional meal expenses shall be reimbursed.
5. However, this section does not provide information on the daily expense rate for business travel that doesn't span a complete 24-hour period.
6. Considering that the per diem rate is likely to be applied to the entire day, and the State Travel Expense Act does not provide a specific daily rate, we can assume that the per diem rate mentioned in the relevant section (25% for breakfast and 25% for lunch and dinner) is applicable to the entire day.
7. Therefore, the daily expense rate for business travel that doesn't span a complete 24-hour period can be calculated as follows:
   - Breakfast: 25% of the per diem
   - Lunch and dinner: 25% of the per diem
   - Total: 50% of the per diem

Here's a step-by-step approach:

**Step 1: Identify the starting point of the trip**

* According to § C, the duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises.
* If the trip begins or ends at the official premises, the starting and ending points of the trip are generally determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness (§ Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement).
* If the official superior has designated the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip, this takes precedence.

**Step 2: Determine the official premises**

* The official premises are the location where the official business is conducted.
* If the trip begins or ends at the official premises, the starting and ending points of the trip are determined by the official premises.
* If the trip begins or ends at a location other than the official premises, the nearest residence or accommodation is considered (§ C).

**Step 3: Consider the nature of the trip**

* If the trip is an official trip abroad, the country is deemed reached when the airplane lands (§ Official Trips Abroad).
* If the trip is an official errand, the place of residence is deemed equivalent to a temporary residence (§ Official Trips and Errands).

**Step 4: Determine the duration of the trip**

* If the trip is an official trip abroad, the duration is determined from the time the airplane lands in the country (§ Official Trips Abroad).
* If the trip is an official errand, the duration is determined from the time the traveler departs from and returns to the official premises or residence.
* If the trip is an extended stay at a business location (more than 7 days), the same reimbursement is granted as would be provided for a secondment, with all days between the day of arrival and the day of departure counted as days of stay (§ Reimbursement of Expenses for an Extended Stay at the Business Location).

* The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises (State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §).
* The duration of an official trip is also affected by the type of travel, with air travel and sea travel having different rules.

**Step 2: Analyze relevant sections**

* State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § states that official trips in general are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
* For foreign travel, a country is deemed reached at the time the airplane lands (State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §).
* Stopovers are disregarded unless they necessitate an overnight stay (State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §).
* The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § also states that the duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises.

**Step 3: Determine the factors that decide the duration of business travel**

Based on the analysis, the following factors decide how long business travel will last:

1. **Type of travel**: The duration of the official trip is affected by the type of travel, with air travel and sea travel having different rules.
2. **Location**: The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises.

6. **Foreign per diem and accommodation**: Foreign per diem and accommodation allowance are granted according to the Federal Foreign Travel Expense Regulation (ARV) and the general administrative regulation on the determination of foreign per diem and accommodation allowances (ARVVwV).
7. **Expense allowance**: Official travelers may be compensated by an expense allowance in lieu of per diem, accommodation allowance, and reimbursement of expenses under §, depending on their individual circumstances.
8. **Eligibility determination**: The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority determines eligibility for per diem reimbursement, considering the individual circumstances of the official traveler.

In summary, eligibility for per diem reimbursement on work-related trips is determined by the official trip's duration, eligibility criteria, and individual circumstances, with specific rules and regulations governing foreign per diem and accommodation allowance.","For errands lasting more than eight hours, the necessary documented expenses for meals shall be reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance states that for official errands, there is no entitlement to a per diem allowance.
2. For errands lasting more than 8 hours, necessary documented expenses for meals are reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.
3. If official travelers receive complimentary meals, a percentage of the per diem is withheld.
4. The duration of an official trip is determined from the time of departure and arrival, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises.
5. Per diem and accommodation allowances abroad are granted in accordance with the Federal Foreign Travel Expense Regulation (ARV) and the general administrative regulation on the determination of foreign per diem and accommodation allowances (ARVVwV).

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Official Errands:** According to § C Per Diem Allowance, there is no entitlement to a per diem allowance for official errands. However, for errands lasting more than 8 hours, documented expenses for meals can be reimbursed up to the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.
2. **Complimentary Meals:** If official travelers receive complimentary meals, a percentage of the per diem is withheld (e.g., 25% for breakfast and 50% each for lunch and dinner).
3. **Official Trip Duration:** The duration of an official trip is determined from the time of departure and arrival, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises. This means that the per diem allowance is calculated based on the actual duration of the trip, not just the number of hours spent on official business.
4. **Abroad:** Per diem and accommodation allowances abroad are governed by the Federal Foreign Travel Expense Regulation (ARV) and the general administrative regulation on the determination of foreign per diem and accommodation allowances (ARVVwV).
5. **Per Diem Allowance:** The per diem allowance is granted for each full calendar day of an official trip, with the amount varying depending on the duration of the trip (e.g., €100 for a full day, €50 for less than 8 hours).

**Conclusion:**

Based on the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance, the rules regarding per diem and official business are as follows:

* There is no entitlement to a per diem allowance for official errands, but documented expenses for meals can be reimbursed up to the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.
* Complimentary meals result in a percentage of the per diem being withheld.
* The duration of an official trip determines the per diem allowance, with the actual duration of the trip, not just the number of hours spent on official business.
* Per diem and accommodation allowances abroad are governed by the Federal Foreign Travel Expense Regulation (ARV) and the general administrative regulation on the determination of foreign per diem and accommodation allowances (ARVVwV).

1. Key fact: The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance states that if official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, a certain percentage of the per diem for breakfast and a percentage for lunch and dinner shall be withheld from the entitled per diem.

2. Key fact: The percentage withheld for breakfast is not specified, but it is mentioned that for lunch and dinner, the percentage withheld is  percent.

3. Reasoning: Since the percentage withheld for lunch and dinner is specified as percent, we can assume that the percentage withheld for breakfast is also percent, as the text does not provide any indication that the percentage for breakfast is different.

4. Conclusion: Therefore, in case of receiving complimentary meals,  percent of the per diem allowance for breakfast and  percent for lunch and dinner shall be withheld from the entitled per diem.","20% of the daily per diem will be withheld for breakfast, and 40% each for lunch and dinner if a traveler receives complimentary meals, is provided meals by a third party, or does not avail themselves of complimentary meals without a compelling reason.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

* Official travelers receive a per diem allowance to compensate for additional expenses for meals.
* If official travelers receive complimentary meals, a percentage of the per diem allowance is withheld from the entitled per diem.
* The percentage withheld depends on the type of meal:
	+ Breakfast: % of the full per diem
	+ Lunch and dinner: % of the full per diem

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. Determine the type of meal provided: 
   * Breakfast, lunch, or dinner

2. If the meal is complimentary, calculate the percentage to be withheld from the per diem allowance:
   * Breakfast: % of the full per diem
   * Lunch and dinner: % of the full per diem

3. Calculate the amount to be withheld from the per diem allowance:
   * For breakfast: (percentage of full per diem) x (full per diem)
   * For lunch and dinner: (percentage of full per diem) x (full per diem)

4. Subtract the withheld amount from the full per diem allowance to determine the reduced daily allowance.

**Example:**

Suppose the full per diem allowance is €100 and the meal is provided for free.

* Breakfast: % of €100 = €10 (€100 x 0.1)
* Lunch and dinner: % of €100 = €20 (€100 x 0.2)
* Total withheld amount = €10 + €20 = €30
* Reduced daily allowance = €100 - €30 = €70

Therefore, when meals are provided for free, my daily allowance is reduced by €30 (€10 for breakfast and €20 for lunch and dinner).","20% of the daily per diem will be withheld for breakfast, and 40% each for lunch and dinner if a traveler receives complimentary meals, is provided meals by a third party, or does not avail themselves of complimentary meals without a compelling reason.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

	* € abroad
2. Higher accommodation costs shall be reimbursed to the necessary extent.
3. An administrative regulation shall determine up to what amount accommodation costs are considered necessary.

**Reasoning:**

To calculate the sum received for a necessary overnight stay, we need to consider the lump sum amounts for domestic and foreign travel.

1. For a necessary overnight stay domestically, the lump sum is €.
2. For a necessary overnight stay abroad, the lump sum is €.
3. The problem does not specify the specific country or region, so we will assume a general case.

**Conclusion:**

The sum received for a necessary overnight stay is the sum of the lump sum amounts for domestic and foreign travel, which is € + € = €.","For a necessary overnight stay, official travelers receive a lump sum of 20 euros domestically and 30 euros abroad.

2. Higher accommodation costs are reimbursed to the necessary extent.
3. The administrative regulation shall determine up to what amount accommodation costs are considered necessary.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) does not specify a fixed amount for accommodation costs, but rather states that official travelers receive a lump sum of euros for necessary overnight stays domestically and euros abroad.
2. However, it is mentioned that higher accommodation costs are reimbursed to the necessary extent, implying that the reimbursement amount may be higher than the lump sum.
3. The administrative regulation shall determine up to what amount accommodation costs are considered necessary, suggesting that the reimbursement amount is subject to a maximum limit.

**Answer:**

Based on the provided text, it appears that the amount of money provided to cover the cost of required overnight accommodations is not a fixed amount, but rather a lump sum that is subject to reimbursement up to a certain extent. The exact amount of the lump sum is not specified in the provided text, but it is mentioned that higher accommodation costs are reimbursed to the necessary extent.

Therefore, the answer is: The amount of money provided to cover the cost of required overnight accommodations is not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it is implied that it is a lump sum that is subject to reimbursement up to a certain extent.","For a necessary overnight stay, official travelers receive a lump sum of 20 euros domestically and 30 euros abroad.

**Key Facts:**

1. The stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days.
2. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § states that reimbursement for the stay is granted as would be provided for a secondment from the eighth day onward.
3. The same rules apply for official trips abroad, with a reduction in foreign per diem from the eighth day onward.

**Reasoning:**

From the key facts, we can see that the initial seven-day period is not subject to the same rules as the extended stay. The Act states that the reimbursement for the stay is granted as would be provided for a secondment from the eighth day onward. This implies that the same reimbursement rules apply to the extended stay as they would if the stay were to be considered a secondment.

Therefore, when the stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days, the reimbursement for the stay is granted as would be provided for a secondment from the eighth day onward, not as a separate per diem or accommodation allowance.

In other words, the extended stay is treated as a secondment, and the reimbursement rules for secondments apply.","If the stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days, from the eighth day onward the same reimbursement is granted as would be provided in the case of a secondment.

**Key Facts:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § states that if a stay at the same external business location lasts longer than 7 days, reimbursement is granted as if it were a secondment from the 8th day onwards.
2. The Act defines an official trip as a journey undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
3. The Act also states that an official trip includes journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work, as long as the conditions are met.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Initial Implication**: If a business trip lasts longer than 7 days, the initial implication is that it will be treated as an extended stay at the business location.
2. **Reimbursement**: According to the Act, from the 8th day onwards, the same reimbursement is granted as would be provided in the case of a secondment. This means that the employee will receive the same compensation as if they were seconded to the business location for the remainder of the trip.
3. **Accommodation Costs**: The Act also states that all days between the day of arrival and the day of departure are counted as days of stay. This means that the employee will be reimbursed for the full duration of the trip, including the initial 7 days.
4. **Per Diem Reduction**: However, if the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than 14 days, the foreign per diem allowance will be reduced by 50% from the 15th day onwards. This reduction does not apply to the initial 7 days, as the trip has already exceeded the 7-day threshold.
5. **Conclusion**: In summary, a business trip exceeding a week in duration will be treated as an extended stay at the business location from the 8th day onwards, with the same reimbursement as a secondment. The employee will receive full reimbursement for the full duration of the trip, including the initial 7 days, and the per diem allowance will only be reduced by 50% from the 15th day onwards, if applicable.","If the stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days, from the eighth day onward the same reimbursement is granted as would be provided in the case of a secondment.

**Step 1: Identify the key facts:**

- The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) states that for official travel, you may be compensated by an expense allowance in lieu of per diem, accommodation allowance, and reimbursement of expenses under §, corresponding to the necessary expenses.

- This compensation is determined by the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority.

- The Act also mentions that for regular or similar official trips, a lump sum reimbursement in lieu of the travel expense reimbursement or individual components thereof may be granted.

**Step 2: Analyze the conditions for receiving a single expense allowance:**

- The Act states that this compensation is available for ""official travelers, for whom generally lower expenses for meals and accommodation are incurred.""

- It is up to the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority to determine if you are eligible for this compensation.

- The compensation is based on the necessary expenses, which means it's tied to the actual costs incurred.

**Step 3: Reason through the answer:**

- If you are an official traveler who incurs lower expenses for meals and accommodation, you may be eligible for a single expense allowance.

- This allowance is meant to compensate you for the necessary expenses, which could include meals and accommodation.

- The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority will determine the amount of the allowance based on your specific situation.

- If you are not an official traveler who incurs lower expenses, you will still be entitled to reimbursement for the necessary expenses, but it will be split into separate payments for meals and accommodation.

- The Act also mentions a lump sum reimbursement for regular or similar official trips, but this is not directly related to receiving a single expense allowance for meals and accommodation.

**Conclusion:**

You would receive a single expense allowance instead of the usual separate payments for meals and hotels if you are an official traveler who incurs lower expenses for meals and accommodation, and the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority determines that you are eligible for this compensation.","Official travelers, for whom generally lower expenses for meals and accommodation are incurred, may, as determined by the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority, be compensated by an expense allowance in lieu of per diem, accommodation allowance, and reimbursement of expenses under § 8, corresponding to the necessary expenses.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  allows for lump sum reimbursement for regular or similar official trips.
2. The amount of the lump sum reimbursement is determined based on the average of the individual reimbursements otherwise incurred in a certain period.
3. For official travelers who generally incur lower expenses for meals and accommodation, an expense allowance may be granted in lieu of per diem, accommodation allowance, and reimbursement of expenses.

**Reasoning:**

To receive a lump sum reimbursement for all costs, the official traveler must meet the following conditions:

1. The trip must be a regular or similar official trip (LRKG § ).
2. The official traveler must be reimbursed for the necessary additional expenses incurred due to the official travel (LRKG § ).
3. The official traveler must not be reimbursed for meals and accommodation expenses separately, as these are covered by the expense allowance (LRKG § ).

**Conclusion:**

Based on the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG), an official traveler would receive a lump sum reimbursement for all costs if:

* The trip is a regular or similar official trip (LRKG § ).
* The official traveler is reimbursed for necessary additional expenses due to the official travel (LRKG § ).
* The official traveler is not reimbursed for meals and accommodation expenses separately, but instead receives an expense allowance (LRKG § ).

4. This implies that the lump sum reimbursement is a standard or average amount for official trips, rather than a per-incident or per-trip reimbursement.
5. The fact that the lump sum reimbursement is based on an average of individual reimbursements suggests that it is intended to cover a range of expenses, rather than a single expense.
6. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  also mentions that official travelers with lower expenses for meals and accommodation may be compensated by an expense allowance, which further supports the idea that a lump sum reimbursement is intended to cover a range of expenses.

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) states that if official trips are canceled for reasons not attributable to the official traveler, the necessary expenses incurred in preparation, which are eligible for reimbursement, shall be reimbursed.
2. Expenses of the official traveler and any accompanying persons that arise due to the interruption or early termination of a vacation or another private trip shall be reimbursed to an appropriate extent.
3. The entitlement to travel expense reimbursement expires if it is not applied for in writing or electronically within a six-month limitation period after the end of the official trip.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. Your travel plans are canceled, which means the trip is not attributable to you.
2. Since the trip is canceled, the necessary expenses incurred in preparation, which are eligible for reimbursement, will be reimbursed (Section 1 of the State Travel Expense Act).
3. This implies that you are entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred before the trip was canceled.
4. The six-month limitation period for applying for reimbursement starts after the end of the official trip. Since the trip was canceled, the end date of the trip is not relevant for the six-month period.
5. The limitation period ends on the day after the end of the trip, but since the trip was canceled, this date is irrelevant for the six-month period.
6. The competent authorities may require the submission of relevant cost receipts up to six months after the application. However, this does not affect the entitlement to reimbursement for expenses incurred before the trip was canceled.
7. As the expenses incurred before the trip was canceled are eligible for reimbursement, you should be able to get your money back for those expenses.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG), you will be able to get your money back for expenses already incurred if your travel plans are called off, as the necessary expenses incurred in preparation are reimbursable.","If official trips are canceled for reasons not attributable to the official traveler, the necessary expenses incurred in preparation, which are eligible for reimbursement under this Act, shall be reimbursed.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

1. Key facts:
   - The per diem allowance is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work.
   - The per diem allowance is granted until the end of the day of arrival, if from the following day onward a separation allowance for staying away is received.
   - An accommodation allowance is also granted.

2. Reasoning:
   - The per diem allowance is granted until the end of the day of arrival, which indicates that the duration of the allowance is tied to the day of arrival.
   - However, if the official receives a separation allowance for staying away from the following day onward, the per diem allowance is not granted anymore. This suggests that the per diem allowance is only granted until the day before the separation allowance is received.
   - Therefore, the per diem allowance is granted for the day of arrival and the day before the separation allowance is received, which means it is granted for 2 days.

In conclusion, the per diem allowance is granted for 2 days in the case of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment.","For official trips on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment, the per diem allowance is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

* According to §  in the State Travel Expense Act, officials on probation in the preparatory service receive a separation allowance of percent of the compensation provided in paragraph  in the case of secondments within the framework of training.
* The official place of duty for training purposes is determined by the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority.
* The same rule applies to secondments within the framework of training or induction service, or a training or induction period necessary for obtaining the qualifications for a career.
* For officials and judges who are seconded to a location outside their official or residential area without a promise of moving expense reimbursement, a separation allowance is granted for the necessary expenses incurred as a result, taking into account the savings at home.

**Reasoning:**

From the above facts, we can infer that the separation allowance is granted for a specific period, but the duration is not explicitly stated. However, we can find relevant information in other sections of the State Travel Expense Act.

* According to §, the per diem allowance is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work.
* According to §, the per diem allowance is granted until the end of the day of arrival, if from the following day onward a separation allowance for staying away is received.
* Additionally, according to §, if the stay at the same external business location lasts longer than seven days, from the eighth day onward, the same reimbursement is granted as would be provided in the case of a secondment.

**Answer:**

Based on the above information, it appears that the daily allowance continues to be paid for a period of seven days after the official's arrival at the new place of work. This is because the per diem allowance is granted until the end of the day of arrival, and if the stay lasts longer than seven days, the same reimbursement is granted as would be provided in the case of a secondment, which typically lasts for a longer period.

Therefore, the daily allowance continues to be paid for a period of seven days after the official's arrival at the new place of work.","For official trips on the occasion of a transfer, secondment, or termination of a secondment, the per diem allowance is granted for the period until arrival at the new place of work.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

2. The per diem allowance is granted for the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time.
3. For official errands, there is no entitlement to a per diem allowance.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. The question specifically asks about the per diem allowance provided on the day of arrival at a new place of work.
2. According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance, the per diem allowance is granted for each full calendar day of an official trip.
3. Since the question is about the day of arrival, it is considered a full calendar day.
4. The per diem allowance is granted for the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time.
5. Since the question is about the day of arrival at a new place of work, the official traveler has arrived at this new place of work, and it is likely that this is the country they last reached before midnight local time.
6. Therefore, the per diem allowance for the day of arrival at a new place of work is the standard per diem allowance for a full calendar day, which is euros.

Key facts:

1. The per diem allowance is granted for official trips.
2. The per diem allowance is granted for each full calendar day of an official trip.
3. For an official trip lasting less than one full calendar day, the per diem allowance is granted for the day of departure and the day of return of a multi-day trip.
4. The per diem allowance is granted until the end of the day of arrival if from the following day onward a separation allowance for staying away is received.

Reasoning:

From the key facts, we can see that the per diem allowance is granted for official trips, and it is calculated for each full calendar day. However, when considering the arrival date at a new workplace, we need to look at the specific section of the act that addresses this situation.

According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance, the per diem allowance is granted for the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time. If the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem shall be granted for the country of the last business location abroad.

Since the arrival date at a new workplace is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, we can infer that it falls under the category of ""official trips"" and ""the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time."" Therefore, the per diem allowance is applicable for the duration of the day of arrival.

However, the context also mentions that if from the following day onward a separation allowance for staying away is received, the per diem allowance is granted until the end of the day of arrival. This implies that the per diem allowance is applicable for the duration of the day of arrival, but the exact duration is not explicitly stated.

Based on the provided context, the per diem allowance is applicable for the duration of the day of arrival, but the exact length of time is not specified.

**Key Facts:**

1. The official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip.
2. The official trip is undertaken for an official reason.
3. The travel expense reimbursement is calculated as if only the official trip were undertaken.

**Reasoning:**

1. According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases, if an official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip, the travel expense reimbursement shall be calculated as if only the official trip were undertaken.
2. This means that the reimbursement will only cover the official trip, and not the vacation or private trip.
3. The Act does not provide any specific guidance on how to handle the combined trip, but it does state that the reimbursement shall not exceed the travel expense reimbursement resulting from the actual course of the trip.
4. Since the official trip is the primary purpose of the trip, it is likely that the reimbursement will cover the official expenses incurred during the combined trip, but not the expenses incurred during the vacation or private portion of the trip.

**Conclusion:**

**Key Facts:**

1. The trip is a combination of business and personal travel.
2. The official trip is not the sole purpose of the trip.

**Step 1: Analyze the Scope of the Act**
The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) regulates the reimbursement of expenses for official trips and official errands, as well as for trips for the purpose of education or training.

**Step 2: Identify Relevant Sections**
The relevant sections of the Act are:
- § 1: Travel expense reimbursement includes reimbursement of travel and flight costs, mileage allowance, per diem allowance for official trips, necessary additional expenses on official errands, accommodation allowance, and other costs.
- § G: Per diem allowance for official trips and necessary additional expenses on official errands.
- § G: Expenses of the official traveler and any accompanying persons that arise due to the interruption or early termination of a vacation or another private trip.

**Step 3: Determine Reimbursement for Business and Personal Travel**
According to § 1, the travel expense reimbursement includes reimbursement of travel and flight costs, mileage allowance, and per diem allowance for official trips. However, the Act does not specifically address reimbursement for personal travel.

**Step 4: Analyze the Special Cases**
The relevant sections for personal travel are § G and § G. These sections state that expenses of the official traveler and any accompanying persons that arise due to the interruption or early termination of a vacation or another private trip shall be reimbursed to an appropriate extent. However, this section does not address reimbursement for personal travel expenses.

**Step 5: Conclusion**
Based on the analysis, the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) does not specifically address reimbursement for personal travel expenses. Therefore, expenses for a business trip combined with personal travel will not be reimbursed in their entirety.

**Answer:** Expenses will not be reimbursed for the entire trip. Only official expenses, such as travel and flight costs, mileage allowance, and per diem allowance for official trips, will be reimbursed.

*   The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  defines official trips as journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which have been ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
*   Official trips can also include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work, provided that the conditions of the act are met.
*   The starting and ending points of an official trip are generally determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness, unless the official superior designates the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip.
*   If an official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip, the travel expense reimbursement is calculated as if only the official trip were undertaken.
*   If it is ordered or approved that the official trip is to commence or conclude at the vacation location, the travel expense reimbursement is calculated based on the departure from or arrival at that location.
*   If an official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip and the official trip is not commenced or concluded at the vacation location, the travel expense reimbursement is calculated based on the distance from or to the residence.

Based on these key facts, we can determine that when a business trip starts or ends at the same place as a personal vacation, the travel costs are reimbursed based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official superior designates the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  The business trip starts or ends at the same place as a personal vacation.
2.  The official trip is subject to the principles of cost-effectiveness and the official superior's approval.
3.  The starting and ending points of the official trip are generally determined by the traveler in accordance with the principle of cost-effectiveness.
4.  Since the business trip starts or ends at the same place as a personal vacation, the official superior may designate the official premises as the starting and/or ending point of the trip.

The Act states that expenses for accommodation at the business location shall be reimbursed for each full calendar day of the hospital stay if an official traveler falls ill and is admitted to a hospital (State Travel Expense Act § Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases).

4. The Act regulates the reimbursement of expenses for official trips and official errands, including travel and flight costs, mileage allowance, per diem allowance, and other costs.

**Reasoning:**

The State Travel Expense Act explicitly states that expenses for accommodation at the business location shall be reimbursed for each full calendar day of the hospital stay if an official traveler falls ill and is admitted to a hospital.

* You are on a business trip and require hospitalization.
* You are an official traveler.
* You have a valid reason for the business trip.

**Step 2: Determine the applicable section of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG)**

* The relevant section is Section  Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases (LRKG § ).

**Step 3: Analyze the section**

* According to Section  Determination of the Travel Expense Reimbursement in Special Cases, expenses of the official traveler and any accompanying persons that arise due to the interruption or early termination of a vacation or another private trip shall be reimbursed to an appropriate extent.
* This section does not specifically mention hospitalization, but it implies that expenses incurred due to unforeseen circumstances, such as hospitalization, may be reimbursed.

**Step 4: Consider the general provision for medical expenses**

* According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § Reimbursement of Other Costs C, if official trips are canceled for reasons not attributable to the official traveler, the necessary expenses incurred in preparation, which are eligible for reimbursement under this Act, shall be reimbursed.
* Although this section does not directly address medical expenses, it suggests that expenses incurred due to unforeseen circumstances, such as hospitalization, may be reimbursed.

**Step 5: Determine the applicable provision for reimbursement of medical costs**

* After analyzing the relevant sections, it appears that medical costs incurred due to hospitalization on a business trip may be reimbursed, but the exact scope and conditions are not explicitly stated.
* However, the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § Reimbursement of Travel and Flight Costs does mention reimbursement of necessary costs incurred for journeys using regularly scheduled public transport up to the cost of the lowest travel class.
* It can be inferred that medical costs, as a necessary expense, may be reimbursed up to the cost of the lowest class.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, it appears that medical costs incurred due to hospitalization on a business trip may be reimbursed, but the exact scope and conditions are not explicitly stated.

5. Official trips should only be carried out if a less costly method of conducting official business is not possible or reasonable.

**Reasoning:**

3. Official trips are journeys undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
4. The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically.

**Reasoning:**

To qualify as official international travel, the trip must meet the following criteria:

1. **Location**: The trip must take place between the domestic territory and foreign countries (or within foreign countries) and at least one business location must be located abroad.
2. **Purpose**: The trip must be for official business, which means it must be related to the official duties and responsibilities of the individual.

2. **Key Fact 2**: If the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem shall be granted for the country of the last business location abroad.

3. **Key Fact 3**: The official trips abroad are defined as trips between the domestic territory and foreign countries, as well as within foreign countries, with at least one business location located abroad.

4. **Key Fact 4**: The per diem and accommodation allowance are granted in accordance with the provisions of the current version of § of the Federal Foreign Travel Expense Regulation (ARV) and the general administrative regulation on the determination of foreign per diem and accommodation allowances (ARVVwV).

Now, let's reason through the answer:

An airplane layover can be considered an extended stay, especially if the traveler is required to wait for the flight to depart or arrive at the destination.
4.

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) states that if the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than 7 days, the foreign per diem shall be reduced by 10% from the 8th day onward.
2. The reduction is only applicable for the duration of the stay at the same business location, not for the entire trip.

**Reasoning:**

1. The question asks about the foreign per diem after 14 days of staying at the same business location. This is more than the 7-day threshold mentioned in the Act.
2. According to the Act, the foreign per diem is reduced by 10% from the 8th day onward.

   - It only mentions the reduction starting from the 8th day, indicating that the reduction applies to the days after the initial 7 days.
   - Therefore, for the first 7 days, the full daily allowance applies, and only from the 8th day onward, the allowance is reduced by 10%.

**Answer:**
Yes, the daily allowance is adjusted for an extended stay at the same business location overseas. However, the adjustment starts from the 8th day onward, not from the beginning of the extended stay. For the first 7 days, the full daily allowance applies.","If the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than 14 days, the foreign per diem according to paragraph 3 shall be reduced by 25 percent from the 15th day onward.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

Key facts:

* The per diem reduction applies if the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than 7 days.
* The per diem reduction is applied from the 8th day onward.
* The reduction amount is 5%.

Now, let's break down the reasoning:

1. The per diem reduction is triggered when the stay at the same foreign business location exceeds 7 days.
2. The reduction takes effect from the 8th day onward, which is the first day after the 7-day threshold.
3. This means that the per diem reduction will be applied to all days after the 7th day, including the 8th day.

Therefore, the per diem reduction takes effect from the 8th day of a long stay abroad.","Instead of the lump sum accommodation allowance, from the 15th day onward, the necessary documented accommodation costs shall be reimbursed.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Step 1: Identify key facts**

* The revised State Travel Expense Act introduces a new regulation for travel costs and mileage allowance.
* The Act aims to modernize the regulatory framework for travel expense reimbursement.
* The Act includes provisions for climate compensation payments for official flights.

**Step 2: Analyze the relevant sections**

**Key Facts:**

1. The updated travel policy, specifically the revised State Travel Expense Act, aims to modernize the regulatory framework for travel expenses.
2. The policy includes changes to regulations for travel costs and mileage allowance, adjustment of per diem allowances, and elimination of special regulations.
3. The policy also introduces a climate compensation payment for official flights.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Climate compensation payment for official flights:** The policy introduces a new regulation for climate compensation payments for officially required flights. This means that the government will have to pay a certain amount of euros for each official flight, which will result in additional costs.
2. **Elimination of rarely occurring special regulations:** The policy eliminates special regulations that were previously in place, but these regulations were not frequently used. While this might seem like a cost-saving measure, the actual effect is that the government will need to invest time and resources into creating new regulations to replace the eliminated ones, which can be considered a cost.
3. **Simplification of regulations:** The policy aims to simplify the application and settlement procedures for official travel, which can lead to reduced administrative effort. However, this simplification might require some initial investment in training and resources to ensure that the new system is implemented correctly.
4. **Elimination of per diem reduction for complimentary meals:** The policy adjusts the reduction of per diem allowances in the case of complimentary meals to align with tax regulations. This change might result in some additional costs for the government, as they may need to adjust their accounting and tax practices to reflect the new rules.
5. **Integration of foreign travel provisions:** The policy integrates the provisions for foreign travel into the Act and the general administrative regulations, which might require some additional resources and effort to implement.

**Conclusion:**

The increased expenses outlined in the updated travel policy are primarily due to the introduction of the climate compensation payment for official flights and the elimination of special regulations. While the policy aims to simplify regulations and reduce bureaucracy, the actual costs associated with implementing the new regulations and adjusting existing practices might offset some of these benefits.

5. The regulations for foreign travel are being integrated into the Act and the general administrative regulations.
6. The revision aims to reduce the density of regulation and eliminate rarely occurring special regulations.

**Reasoning:**

To identify the reason for implementing savings measures like restricted first-class train travel and adjusted per diem reductions, we need to analyze the potential cost savings and benefits of these measures.

2. The Act introduces a new regulation for travel costs and mileage allowance, which replaces previous rules.
3. The revised Act also adjusts the reduction of the per diem allowance in the case of complimentary meals to align with tax regulations.
4. The Act eliminates certain special regulations, such as the authorization to refrain from a reduction in the training area.
5. The climate compensation payment for official flights is introduced.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Limiting First-Class Train Use:**
The revised Act aims to reduce administrative costs and promote more economical travel options. By limiting first-class train use, the government can reduce the costs associated with higher-class travel, which is likely to be more expensive. This change encourages employees to use second-class trains, which are more economical, even for longer distances. This move is likely intended to promote more cost-effective travel choices and reduce the financial burden on the government.
2. **Modifying Daily Allowance Amounts:**
The revised Act adjusts the daily allowance amounts to reflect changes in tax regulations. The previous system allowed for tax deductions on certain expenses, but this was complicated and potentially led to errors. By aligning the daily allowance with tax regulations, the government aims to simplify the process and eliminate the need for tax deductions. This change is likely intended to make the travel expense system more straightforward and easier to administer.

**Rationale:**
The revised Act aims to promote cost-effectiveness, simplify administrative processes, and reduce expenses. By limiting first-class train use and modifying daily allowance amounts, the government can:

* Reduce administrative costs associated with managing travel expenses
* Encourage more economical travel choices
* Simplify the travel expense system by aligning it with tax regulations
* Promote a more cost-effective and efficient use of public funds

Overall, the changes aim to modernize the State Travel Expense Act, making it more efficient, cost-effective, and easier to administer."," The increases in certain compensations (for example, mileage allowance, travel cost reimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) are offset by savings in other provisions (restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains, adjustment of the",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance states that if official travelers receive complimentary meals, a certain percentage of the per diem for breakfast and 2% for lunch and dinner will be withheld.
2. The percentages for withholding are: 2% for breakfast, 2% for lunch, and 2% for dinner.
3. The same percentages apply if meals are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses.
4. The reduction of the per diem allowance applies if the official traveler does not have a compelling reason for not availing themselves of the complimentary meals.

**Reasoning:**

To calculate the reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals, we need to determine the total percentage of the per diem that is withheld due to the complimentary meals.

For breakfast, 2% of the per diem is withheld.
For lunch, 2% of the per diem is withheld.
For dinner, 2% of the per diem is withheld.

The total percentage of the per diem withheld due to complimentary meals is: 2% (breakfast) + 2% (lunch) + 2% (dinner) = 6%.

This means that if the official traveler receives complimentary meals, 6% of the per diem will be withheld, and the actual per diem allowance will be reduced by 6%.

**Conclusion:**

To determine the reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals, we need to calculate the total percentage of the per diem that is withheld due to the complimentary meals. In this case, 6% of the per diem is withheld, resulting in a reduction of the per diem allowance.",regulations).,COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

To determine the mileage rate for a vehicle that received approval prior to January 1, 2018, we need to consider the previous mileage rates.

The explanatory memorandum mentions that the previous rates were G,, and cents/km, depending on the vehicle's engine capacity and approval for official travel. However, it does not provide specific details on the rates for vehicles that received approval prior to January 1, 2018.

Since the new regulation eliminates the need for approval and the previous additional allowance for accompanying persons, we can infer that the mileage rate for vehicles that received approval prior to January 1, 2018, is likely to be one of the previous rates.

Given that the explanatory memorandum does not provide a clear answer, we need to look for a specific section that addresses this issue. Unfortunately, there is no direct mention of the mileage rate for vehicles that received approval prior to January 1, 2018.

However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the mileage rate for vehicles that received approval prior to January 1, 2018, is likely to be the rate that was in effect before the new regulation took effect.

1. **Key Facts:**
   - Your private vehicle has been approved for official travel before the end of 2017.
   - The revised State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) states that as of the revised version, only two rates apply for mileage allowance.
   - The rates are: 
     - cents/km if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle.
     - cents/km in all other cases.

2. **Reasoning:**
   - Since your vehicle was approved for official travel before the end of 2017, it falls under the previous regulation that considered the vehicle's engine capacity and the presence of compelling reasons for its use.
   - The previous regulation mentioned three different rates (G,, and cents/km), depending on the vehicle's engine capacity and compelling reasons for its use.
   - Given that your vehicle has been approved for official travel, it likely falls under the category of employees who, under the law in force until December, fulfilled the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel (in particular, field employees).
   - This means the previous additional allowance of cents/km for accompanying persons is eliminated, but since you're not specified to have an accompanying person, we only consider the vehicle usage.
   - Therefore, the applicable mileage allowance rate is cents/km, as this rate is intended to cover the ongoing operating costs and is applicable to employees who have fulfilled the requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Key Facts:**
   - The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Mileage Allowance states that for journeys undertaken by official travelers using a private motor vehicle or any other vehicle not mentioned in §, a mileage allowance is granted.
   - The mileage allowance amounts to  cents per kilometer traveled.
   - However, for official travelers who have a disability degree of at least  percent, the expenses for the next higher class shall be reimbursed.
   - The problem statement does not specify the exact disability degree, but it implies that the traveler is unable to walk due to a leg disability.

2. **Reasoning:**
   - Since the traveler is unable to walk due to a leg disability, they likely require the use of a higher class of vehicle to ensure their safety and mobility.
   - The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Mileage Allowance states that for official travelers who have a disability degree of at least  percent, the expenses for the next higher class shall be reimbursed.
   - Therefore, if the traveler's disability degree is  percent or higher, they would be entitled to the mileage reimbursement rate for the next higher class.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Unfortunately, the problem statement does not provide the exact disability degree, but based on the information provided in the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) §  Mileage Allowance, we can conclude that the mileage reimbursement rate for someone unable to walk due to a leg disability would be the rate for the next higher class, which is  cents per kilometer.

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) states that an official traveler with a disability degree of at least  percent is entitled to reimbursement for travel or flight costs of the lowest class.
2. The mileage allowance is granted for journeys undertaken by official travelers using a private motor vehicle or any other vehicle not mentioned in §.
3. The mileage allowance amounts to  cents per kilometer traveled.
4. With the consent of the highest competent authority, a surcharge may be granted for the mileage allowance if the official business requires journeys on unpaved roads or difficult-to-drive field or forest tracks.

**Reasoning:**

1. The question states that the traveler has a severe disability affecting their right leg, which prevents them from walking.
2. Since the traveler has a disability degree of at least  percent, they are entitled to reimbursement for travel or flight costs of the lowest class, according to §.
3. The question does not specify whether the traveler is using a private motor vehicle or another vehicle. However, since the mileage allowance is granted for journeys undertaken by official travelers using a private motor vehicle or any other vehicle not mentioned in §, it is likely that the traveler is using a vehicle that is not mentioned in §.
4. Since the traveler has a severe disability, it is likely that the official business requires the use of a vehicle that is not approved for official travel (i.e., a private vehicle).
5. According to the new regulation, if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle, the mileage allowance is  cents per kilometer traveled. Since the traveler has a severe disability, it is likely that the official business requires the use of a private vehicle, and therefore, the mileage allowance of  cents per kilometer traveled applies.

2. The revised version of the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) eliminates the previous distinction between different rates for mileage allowance based on vehicle engine capacity and compelling reasons for use.
3. The revised rule introduces a single rate of cents per kilometer for all official travel, regardless of the vehicle used.

**Analyzing the Situation:**

1. According to the revised rule, if a complimentary mode of transport is available, travel costs will not be reimbursed. This implies that if a traveler can use a complimentary mode of transport, they will not be charged for the mileage allowance.
2. If a traveler is sharing a ride, they are not using a separate vehicle, which means they are not using a vehicle that would be subject to the mileage allowance.
3. The revised rule eliminates the distinction between different rates for mileage allowance, so the single rate of cents per kilometer applies to all official travel, regardless of the vehicle used.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, if a traveler is sharing a ride, they would not be subject to a charge of 2 cents per kilometer under the updated rule, as they are not using a separate vehicle that would be subject to the mileage allowance.

* Section  (Entitlement to Travel Expense Reimbursement) mentions that official travelers can choose the means of transport, considering economic and climate protection factors, but travel costs will not be reimbursed if a complimentary mode of transport is available.
* Section  (Official Trips and Errands) defines official trips and errands, but does not mention any specific procedures for authorizing the use of personally owned vehicles.

**Step 3: Reason through the answer**

Based on the analysis, there is no explicit mention of procedures for authorizing the use of personally owned vehicles for work-related trips. The State Travel Expense Act primarily focuses on the reimbursement of travel and flight costs, mileage allowance, and entitlement to travel expense reimbursement. The section on mileage allowance does not provide any information on how to authorize the use of personally owned vehicles.

However, the Act does mention that the formal procedure for ""approval of one's own vehicle for official travel"" is being eliminated, which might imply that there were previous procedures in place for authorizing the use of personally owned vehicles. Nevertheless, the current text does not provide any details on these procedures.

Therefore, the answer is:

**There are no established procedures for authorizing the use of personally owned vehicles for work-related trips, as the State Travel Expense Act does not explicitly mention such procedures.**","25 cents/km in all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another vehicle (for example, bicycle, e-bike).",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

1. **Previous situation**: 
   - There were three different rates (G,, and cents/km) for using one's own vehicle depending on the engine capacity, compelling reasons, and approval for official travel.
   - The vehicle had to belong to the traveler or a person living in a common household.

2. **New regulation**:
   - Only two rates apply in the future: cents/km if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle, and cents/km for all other cases of motor vehicle use.
   - The previous additional allowance of cents/km for accompanying persons is eliminated.
   - The formal procedure for ""approval of one's own vehicle for official travel"" is eliminated.
   - The new regulation aims to simplify the process and encourage the use of bicycles or e-bikes for shorter official trips.

**Analysis**:
The new regulation explicitly states that the formal procedure for ""approval of one's own vehicle for official travel"" is eliminated. This suggests that the previous formal process is no longer applicable. The regulation does not mention any new requirements or procedures for personal car approval for official travel; it simply abolishes the previous system.

**Conclusion**:
Given the elimination of the formal procedure for ""approval of one's own vehicle for official travel"" in the new regulation, it appears that there is no longer a formal process to get your personal car approved for official travel. The new regulation aims to simplify the process and encourage the use of more environmentally friendly options, such as bicycles or e-bikes, without requiring a formal approval for personal car use.","With this new regulation, the formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official travel” is eliminated, as is the previously often cumbersome examination of whether compelling reasons exist.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

5. The mileage allowance for official travel is granted for journeys undertaken by official travelers using a private motor vehicle or any other vehicle not mentioned in the Act.

**Analyzing the Changes:**

1. The elimination of the previous rates for motor vehicle use indicates a change in the requirements for vehicle ownership and mileage reimbursement.
2. The introduction of a new rate of  cents/km for significant official interest suggests that the revised regulation is focused on incentivizing the use of bicycles or e-bikes for shorter official trips.
3. The elimination of the approval process for private vehicles and the examination of compelling reasons for their use simplifies the process and reduces administrative burdens.
4. The new regulation allows for reimbursement of mileage allowance for official travel, regardless of whether the traveler uses their own vehicle or not.

**Key Facts:**

1. According to §, the mileage allowance is granted for journeys undertaken by official travelers using a private motor vehicle or any other vehicle not mentioned in §.
2. The mileage allowance is calculated at cents per kilometer traveled (§).
3. There is a surcharge of cents per kilometer for journeys on unpaved roads or difficult-to-drive field or forest tracks (§).
4. The new regulation (effective from December ) eliminates the need for approval of one's own vehicle for official travel (§).
5. The mileage allowance is now based on the official interest in the use of the vehicle, and only two rates apply: cents/km if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle, and cents/km in all other cases.

**Reasoning:**

1. The new regulation (effective from December ) eliminates the need for approval of one's own vehicle for official travel.
2. This means that, in general, you no longer need to own the vehicle you use for official travel to get mileage reimbursement.
3. The only exception is if there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle, in which case the mileage allowance is cents/km.
4. However, this exception does not imply that you need to own the vehicle to qualify for mileage reimbursement. You can still use a vehicle that is not owned by you, such as a car-sharing model or a rental car, as long as there is a significant official interest in the use of the vehicle.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, you do not necessarily need to own the vehicle you use for official travel to get mileage reimbursement.

**Key Facts:**

* The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § defines an official trip as a journey undertaken to conduct official business outside the usual place of work, which has been ordered or approved by the responsible superior.
* Official trips are reimbursed if they last longer than 7 days, with the same reimbursement rate as a secondment after the 7th day.
* The starting and ending points of an official trip are determined by the traveler, following the principle of cost-effectiveness.
* The reimbursement of travel costs is based on the distance from or to the residence, unless the official premises are designated as the starting and/or ending point.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the key facts, we can conclude that an official trip can qualify for daily expense reimbursement if it lasts longer than 7 days. However, the question asks for the shortest official work trip that qualifies for daily expense reimbursement.

The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § does not specify a minimum duration for official trips to qualify for daily expense reimbursement. However, we can infer that an official trip must be longer than 7 days to qualify for daily reimbursement.

If an official trip is shorter than 7 days, the reimbursement would be based on the distance from or to the residence, which would likely be less than the daily reimbursement rate.

Therefore, the shortest official work trip that qualifies for daily expense reimbursement is 7 days, as it is the minimum duration required to qualify for daily reimbursement after the 7th day.

**Answer:** The shortest official work trip that qualifies for daily expense reimbursement is 7 days.","For the entitlement to mileage allowance, it is no longer required that the traveler uses a vehicle they own.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

1. According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance, a per diem allowance is granted for each full calendar day of an official trip.
2. For official errands lasting more than eight hours, the necessary documented expenses for meals shall be reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.
3. The per diem allowance for an official trip is  euros per day.
4. For an official trip lasting less than one full calendar day, the per diem allowance is  euros for a duration of more than  hours, and  euros for a duration of more than  hours.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. According to the key facts, a per diem allowance is granted for each full calendar day of an official trip.
2. Therefore, we need to identify the minimum duration of an official trip required to be considered a full calendar day.
3. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance states that for an official trip lasting less than one full calendar day, the per diem allowance is  euros for a duration of more than  hours, and  euros for a duration of more than  hours.
4. Since  hours is equivalent to 1 hour, and  hours is equivalent to 1.5 hours, we can conclude that a trip lasting less than 2 hours is not considered a full calendar day.
5. Therefore, the minimum duration of an official trip required to receive per diem is 2 hours.

**Answer:** A trip needs to be at least 2 hours long to receive per diem, but it's not explicitly stated that a trip must be 2 hours or more to receive per diem, however,  the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) does not mention a lower duration to receive per diem, therefore, a trip lasting 2 hours is the minimum duration required to receive per diem.","For the entitlement to mileage allowance, it is no longer required that the traveler uses a vehicle they own.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

2. The minimum duration for a per diem allowance is mentioned in § C For, which corresponds to the previous § U LRKG.
3. The Explanatory Memorandum states that the regulations previously contained in the State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation are simplified and incorporated into the Act.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. According to § C For, the minimum duration for a per diem allowance is increased from exactly eight hours to more than eight hours.
2. Since the minimum duration is increased, it means that the new minimum duration is greater than eight hours.
3. The Explanatory Memorandum states that the regulations previously contained in the State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation are simplified and incorporated into the Act.
4. However, there is no mention of a specific minimum duration in the Explanatory Memorandum that is greater than eight hours.
5. Therefore, we need to look at the original regulation that was repealed, which was the State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation.
6. In the repealed regulation, the minimum duration for a per diem allowance was not explicitly stated, but it was mentioned that the per diem allowance is granted for ""each full calendar day of an official trip"" (§ G).
7. Since the Explanatory Memorandum states that the regulations are simplified, we can infer that the minimum duration for a per diem allowance is now implied to be a full calendar day, which is 24 hours.

**Key Facts:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance states that the per diem allowance is only granted for trips lasting more than 8 hours.
2. The explanatory memorandum mentions that the regulation aims to avoid administratively burdensome taxation of per diem when the trip lasts exactly 8 hours.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Purpose of the regulation**: The regulation aims to simplify the taxation of per diem allowances and avoid administratively burdensome taxation.
2. **Current situation**: Before the revision, per diem allowances were granted for trips lasting exactly 8 hours, which could lead to unnecessary taxation.
3. **New regulation**: The new regulation lengthens the required time for official travel before per diem can be claimed to more than 8 hours. This means that if an official trip lasts exactly 8 hours, no per diem allowance is granted.
4. **Rationale**: The justification behind this change is to avoid the administrative burden of taxation for short trips. By requiring a minimum duration of more than 8 hours, the regulation reduces the likelihood of unnecessary taxation for short trips.
5. **Taxation implications**: By not granting per diem allowances for short trips, the regulation aims to eliminate the need to tax parts of the per diem, which would otherwise be considered taxable income.
6. **Practical implications**: This change may affect employees who travel for short periods, as they may not be able to claim the full per diem allowance. However, it is intended to simplify the tax treatment and reduce administrative burdens.

In summary, the lengthening of the required time for official travel before per diem can be claimed is justified by the need to avoid administratively burdensome taxation of per diem allowances for short trips, thereby simplifying the tax treatment and reducing administrative burdens.",This corresponds to the previous § U LRKG.

**Key Facts:**

1. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) states that the per diem allowance is increased from exactly eight hours to more than eight hours.
2. The purpose of this change is to avoid administratively burdensome taxation of the per diem when the trip lasts exactly eight hours.
3. The previous regulation allowed for a lump sum accommodation allowance for extended stays, but the new regulation simplifies this by reimbursing actual necessary accommodation costs for extended stays.

**Reasoning:**

The reason for increasing the minimum duration of an official trip required to claim per diem is to avoid the administrative burden of taxation on the per diem when the trip lasts exactly eight hours. This suggests that the previous regulation was creating an administrative burden due to the taxation of per diem for trips of exactly eight hours.

By increasing the minimum duration to more than eight hours, the regulation aims to eliminate this administrative burden. This change is intended to simplify the process and reduce the need for complex tax calculations.

In essence, the regulation is trying to avoid taxing a portion of the per diem allowance, which would have been the case when the trip lasted exactly eight hours. By increasing the minimum duration, the regulation can avoid this taxation and provide a more straightforward reimbursement process for official trips that last longer than eight hours.

**Step 1: Identify key facts**

* The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) regulates reimbursement of travel and flight costs for official trips.
* The Act states that the previous withholding provisions, which were separately regulated in other sections, are now adapted to the tax law reduction provisions.
* As a result, tax-relevant amounts will occur only in very rare cases.
* The Act mentions that the Ministry of Finance may adjust the amounts set in certain sections in accordance with changed economic conditions.

**Step 2: Analyze the implications of the key facts**

* The adaptation of the withholding provisions to the tax law reduction provisions suggests that the Act aims to minimize tax-related expenses for official trips.
* The fact that tax-relevant amounts are expected to occur only in very rare cases implies that the Act is designed to reduce the likelihood of tax-related expenses.
* The mention of the Ministry of Finance adjusting the amounts in accordance with changed economic conditions suggests that the Act is flexible and responsive to economic changes.

**Step 3: Reason through the answer**

Based on the key facts and analysis, it can be inferred that tax-related amounts are not typically expected to happen frequently because:

* The Act is designed to minimize tax-related expenses for official trips.
* The adaptation of the withholding provisions to the tax law reduction provisions aims to reduce the likelihood of tax-related expenses.
* The flexibility of the Act to adjust amounts in accordance with economic changes ensures that tax-related expenses are minimized in response to changing economic conditions.

**Step 1: Identify key facts**

* The previous withholding provisions are now adapted to the tax law reduction provisions.
* The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) regulates travel expenses, mileage allowance, and per diem allowance.
* The mileage allowance is now only cents per kilometer traveled if there is a significant official interest in using a motor vehicle.
* A surcharge may be granted for mileage allowance if journeys on unpaved roads or difficult-to-drive field or forest tracks are regularly required.
* The Ministry of Finance can adjust the amounts set in the Act in accordance with changed economic conditions.
* Climate compensation payments are required for official flights, which are reimbursed annually.

**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the key facts and the question**

The question asks why tax-relevant amounts are expected to occur only rarely. We need to find a connection between the key facts and this expectation.

**Step 3: Reason through the answer**

The key fact that ""tax-relevant amounts will occur only in very rare cases"" suggests that the new provisions are designed to minimize tax liabilities. This is achieved through:

* Adapting previous withholding provisions to tax law reduction provisions, which reduces the likelihood of tax liabilities.
* Limiting the mileage allowance to cents per kilometer, which reduces the potential for tax liabilities.
* Requiring climate compensation payments only for official flights, which limits the scope of tax-relevant amounts.

The expectation that tax-relevant amounts will occur only rarely is likely due to these design changes, which aim to minimize tax liabilities and reduce the need for tax withholding.

**Answer**: The main reason we expect to see tax-relevant amounts occur only rarely is that the new provisions are designed to minimize tax liabilities through adaptations to tax law reduction provisions, limiting mileage allowance, and requiring climate compensation payments only for official flights.","The previous withholding provisions, which were separately regulated in §§ 12 and 10 (3) LRKG, are now adapted to the tax law reduction provisions.

* The percentage for breakfast is not specified, but it is mentioned that breakfast as a meal component shall be taken into account in the per diem by withholding a certain percentage (not specified) of the full per diem.
* The text does not explicitly state that meals in the morning are covered by the price of the room.

**Step 2: Analyze the relevant sections**

* Section LRKG § C Per Diem Allowance states that if official travelers receive complimentary meals, a certain percentage of the per diem allowance is withheld from the entitled per diem.
* Section LRKG § C Per Diem Allowance also states that breakfast as a meal component shall be taken into account in the per diem by withholding a certain percentage of the full per diem.
* There is no explicit mention of meals in the morning being covered by the price of the room.

**Step 3: Draw a conclusion**

Based on the provided text, there is no clear indication that meals in the morning are covered by the price of the room. The only mention of breakfast is that it is taken into account in the per diem by withholding a certain percentage of the full per diem, but this does not necessarily mean that the price of the room includes breakfast. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that meals in the morning are not automatically covered by the price of the room.

However, it is also possible that the price of the room includes breakfast, but this is not explicitly stated in the text. To determine this, additional information or context would be needed.","The previous withholding provisions, which were separately regulated in §§ 12 and 10 (3) LRKG, are now adapted to the tax law reduction provisions.

2. The Act also states that for a full calendar day, a per diem allowance is granted to compensate for additional expenses for meals.
3. For a full calendar day, a percentage of the per diem is withheld from the entitled per diem for breakfast and a percentage for lunch and dinner.
4. The Act states that breakfast as a meal component shall henceforth be taken into account in the per diem by withholding a certain percentage of the full per diem.

**Analyzing the Relevant Sections:**

* Section LRKG § C Per Diem Allowance states that for each full calendar day of an official trip, a per diem allowance of euros is granted to compensate for additional expenses for meals.
* Section LRKG § Accommodation Allowance states that for a necessary overnight stay, official travelers receive a lump sum of euros domestically and euros abroad for accommodation costs.
* Section LRKG § Accommodation Allowance also states that breakfast as a meal component shall henceforth be taken into account in the per diem by withholding a certain percentage of the full per diem.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the analysis of the key facts and relevant sections, it can be concluded that breakfast is indeed included in the accommodation costs. The State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) specifically states that breakfast as a meal component shall henceforth be taken into account in the per diem by withholding a certain percentage of the full per diem.

1. Key fact: According to State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance, if official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, a certain percentage of the per diem for breakfast and each meal for lunch and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld from the entitled per diem.

2. Reasoning:
   - The text states that the percentage for breakfast is not explicitly mentioned, but it does state that for a full calendar day, a percentage of the per diem for breakfast and each meal for lunch and dinner shall be withheld.
   - However, it does not explicitly state that the percentage for breakfast is the same as the percentage for lunch and dinner.
   - Furthermore, the text states that breakfast as a meal component shall henceforth be taken into account in the per diem by withholding a certain percentage (which is not specified) of the full per diem, implying that the per diem payments will include a breakfast expense.
   - The text also mentions that the same percentage applies if meals are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses, which implies that the percentage for breakfast will be included in the per diem payments.

Considering these points, the per diem payments will indeed include a breakfast expense, but the exact percentage is not specified.","Finally, the regulation for accommodation costs that include breakfast is no longer included.",COT_Prompt,mpnet,False

**Key Facts:**

1. According to the State Travel Expense Act (LRKG) § C Per Diem Allowance, if official travelers receive complimentary meals in the course of their official duties, a certain percentage of the per diem for breakfast and 10% each for lunch and dinner shall be withheld.
2. The same applies if meals are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses.
3. The percentages mentioned in the law apply if the official traveler does not avail himself of the complimentary meals without a compelling reason.

**Reasoning:**

From the above key facts, it is clear that the per diem allowance does consider breakfast when meals are provided by a third party or when the official traveler receives complimentary meals as part of their official duties. However, when the official traveler does not avail himself of the complimentary meals without a compelling reason, the per diem allowance does not consider breakfast.

In other words, the per diem allowance is withheld for breakfast only when meals are provided by a third party or when the official traveler receives complimentary meals, but not when the official traveler chooses not to take advantage of those meals.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:

**No**, the per diem allowance does not consider breakfast when the official traveler does not avail himself of the complimentary meals without a compelling reason.","Breakfast as a meal component shall henceforth be taken into account in the per diem by withholding 20 percent of the full per diem.

**Key Facts:**

1. The updated policy has eliminated the need for an administrative cumbersome application procedure for extending the period during which separation allowance is received.
2. Officials on probation in the preparatory service receive a percentage of their compensation for separation allowance in the case of secondments within the framework of training.
3. The official place of duty for training purposes is determined by the highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority.
4. The updated policy includes a new regulation for travel costs and mileage allowance, as well as adjustments to the reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals.
5. The provisions for foreign trips are integrated into the Act and the general administrative regulations, eliminating the previous State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation.
6. Expenses incurred during an extended stay at the business location, separation allowance, and statutory anchoring of a climate compensation payment for official flights are included in the updated policy.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the key facts, we can conclude that the updated policy has introduced significant changes to the regulations regarding separation allowance payments. The elimination of the administrative cumbersome application procedure and the integration of foreign trip provisions into the Act and general administrative regulations suggest that the policy aims to simplify and streamline the process.

However, the policy also introduces new regulations, such as the statutory anchoring of a climate compensation payment for official flights, which may require additional documentation or approval.

To determine whether a new application is necessary to maintain separation allowance payments beyond the initial period, we need to consider the following:

1. The updated policy does not explicitly state that a new application is required to maintain separation allowance payments.
2. The elimination of the administrative cumbersome application procedure suggests that the policy may not require a new application for extensions beyond the initial period.
3. The integration of foreign trip provisions and other changes may not necessarily require a new application, as these changes are already incorporated into the Act and general administrative regulations.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, it appears that the updated policy does not necessitate a new application to maintain separation allowance payments beyond the initial period. The elimination of the administrative cumbersome application procedure and the integration of foreign trip provisions suggest that the policy aims to simplify and streamline the process. However, it is always best to consult with the relevant authorities or a qualified professional to confirm the specific requirements and ensure compliance with the updated policy.","Breakfast as a meal component shall henceforth be taken into account in the per diem by withholding 20 percent of the full per diem.
