For first-class train use:  
The rationale is that, in principle, only the costs of second-class travel are reimbursed. For train journeys, even over longer distances, second-class is acceptable due to current travel comfort. Exceptions may be permitted in specific cases, and this approach promotes self-responsibility and flexible, needs-based handling of travel expenses. No specific travel time or distance is mandated, allowing for more efficient and cost-effective reimbursement.

For daily allowance modifications:
