3. **Combination with Vacation or Private Trip**: If an official trip is combined with a vacation or another private trip, the travel expense reimbursement is calculated as if only the official trip were undertaken.

These provisions allow for approval of travel expenses beyond the standard class under specific conditions, as determined by the relevant authorities.","If official travelers have a disability degree of at least 50 percent, the expenses for the next higher class shall be reimbursed.

1. **Introduction of New Regulations**: The revised State Travel Expense Act introduces new regulations for travel costs and mileage allowance, which may result in higher reimbursement amounts compared to the previous system.

2. **Adjustment of Per Diem Allowance**: The per diem allowance for meals has been adjusted to align with tax regulations. This change may lead to higher reimbursement for meal expenses, as parts of the per diem are no longer taxable.

3. **Integration of Foreign Travel Provisions**: The provisions for foreign travel are now integrated into the Act and general administrative regulations, which may result in increased costs for international travel.

4. **Reimbursement of Accommodation and Meal Expenses**: For extended stays and secondments, the reimbursement of actual necessary accommodation costs and a lump sum for additional meal expenses is introduced. This could lead to higher expenses for longer trips.

5. **Climate Compensation Payment**: The statutory anchoring of a climate compensation payment for official flights adds to the overall cost of travel, as it is now required for officially required flights.

6. **Elimination of Special Regulations**: The removal of rarely occurring special regulations may not directly increase expenses, but it could lead to a more streamlined process, potentially involving higher administrative costs.

Regarding the modification of daily allowance amounts, the changes align with tax law provisions to ensure that parts of the per diem allowance are not taxed, thereby eliminating the need for taxation of certain components. Additionally, the adjustment reflects a shift towards a more modern regulatory framework that integrates foreign travel provisions into the Act and general administrative regulations, making the previous State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation unnecessary. The changes also aim to simplify procedures, such as eliminating the formal approval process for official travel by private vehicles, and to encourage more environmentally friendly travel options like bicycles or e-bikes for shorter trips.

For train journeys, the limitation to second-class travel is based on the idea that, with current travel comfort levels, second class is sufficiently adequate even for longer distances. This decision aims to reduce costs while still allowing for necessary travel. The highest competent authority may grant exceptions for specific areas of responsibility, which allows for flexibility and promotes departments' self-responsibility in managing travel expenses.

Regarding the modification of daily allowance amounts, the changes align with tax law provisions, thereby eliminating the need to tax parts of the per diem. This adjustment simplifies the financial handling and ensures compliance with current legal standards. Additionally, the integration of foreign travel provisions into the main Act and general administrative regulations streamlines the regulatory framework, making it more efficient and reducing the need for separate, specialized regulations like the previous State Foreign Travel Expense Regulation.

1. For official errands, there is no entitlement to a per diem allowance. However, for errands lasting more than eight hours, the necessary documented expenses for meals shall be reimbursed up to the amount of the per diem allowance applicable for an official trip.

2. If official travelers receive complimentary meals during their official duties, 20 percent of the per diem for breakfast and 40 percent each for lunch and dinner for a full calendar day shall be withheld from the entitled per diem. This also applies if meals are provided by a third party and the charge for them is included in the reimbursable travel, flight, accommodation, or incidental expenses. The same percentages apply if the official traveler does not avail themselves of the complimentary meals without a compelling reason.

3. The duration of the official trip is determined from the time of departure from and arrival at the residence, unless the trip begins or ends at the official premises or the beginning and/or end has been ordered at the official premises. In the case of several residences or accommodations, the one nearest to the official premises shall be decisive.

4. For official trips abroad, the per diem and accommodation allowance shall be granted for the country that the official traveler last reaches before midnight local time. If, during an official trip abroad, the domestic territory is reached last before midnight, foreign per diem shall be granted for the country of the last business location abroad.

5. If the stay at the same foreign business location (excluding departure and return days) lasts longer than 14 days, the foreign per diem according to the relevant paragraph shall be reduced by 25 percent from the 15th day onward. The highest competent authority or its authorized subordinate authority may, in justified cases, waive the reduction. Instead of the lump sum accommodation allowance, from the 15th day onward, the necessary documented accommodation costs shall be reimbursed.

The per diem is granted until the end of the day of arrival, if from the following day onward a separation allowance for staying away is received; in addition, an accommodation allowance (§ ) is granted.

7. For each full calendar day of an official trip, a per diem allowance of 24 euros is granted to compensate for additional expenses for meals.

The order or approval must be given in writing or electronically. Official trips also include journeys from a location serving as a temporary residence to the place of work, provided that the conditions of the relevant sentences are otherwise met.
