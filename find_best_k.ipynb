The new regulations pursue the goal of reducing \\nbureaucracy and meet the demand for a simplification of the application and settlement \\nprocedures and for straightforward rules. The previous travel expense law is outdated and \\nrequires updating and legal simplification to ease the conduct and administrative processing of \\nofficial travel. Overall, the density of regulation is reduced ( instead of  paragraphs and the \\nelimination of one regulation). Furthermore, regarding mobility behavior, the requirements of \\nclimate protection are to be considered (exemplary function of the state administration pursuant \\nto §  of the Climate Protection Act).', 'Explanatory Memorandum A.

Adjustment \\nof the reduction of the per diem in the case of complimentary meals to align with tax regulations: \\nthis regulation eliminates the taxation of parts of the per diem.

General Part – Financial Impact: Additional \\ncosts estimated at , euros result from the climate compensation payment for officially required \\nflights. The increases in certain compensations (for example, mileage allowance, travel cost \\nreimbursement when the trip begins at the residence) are offset by savings in other provisions \\n(restriction of eligibility for first-class travel on trains, adjustment of the reduction of the per diem \\nin the case of complimentary meals in accordance with tax regulations).

Detailed Explanations Regarding §  For paragraph : The definition \\nof the residence relevant for travel expense law is intended to avoid reimbursement of privately \\nincurred high travel costs.', 'Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  \\nFor paragraph : For administrative economy reasons, official travelers are to have the free \\nchoice of means of transport while taking ecological and economic aspects into account.

Otherwise, the regulations essentially correspond to the previous §  LRKG.', 'Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding §  For paragraph : For reasons \\nof administrative simplification and cost, in principle only the costs of second class shall be \\nreimbursed.

Detailed Explanations Regarding \\n§  With the use of one’s own motor vehicle, there were previously three different rates (G, , and  \\ncents/km), depending on whether the vehicle’s engine capacity was above or below G ccm, \\nwhether compelling reasons existed for its use, and whether the vehicle was approved for \\nofficial travel. In addition, the vehicle had to belong to the traveler or to a person living in a \\ncommon household (which repeatedly led to problems, especially in non-marital partnerships). \\nIn the future, only two rates shall apply: –  cents if there is a significant official interest in the use \\nof the vehicle. This includes employees who, under the law in force until December , , fulfilled \\nthe requirements for the approval of their private vehicle for official travel (in particular, field \\nemployees), as well as other employees when carpooling is arranged or in the case of severely \\ndisabled employees. The previous additional allowance of  cents/km for accompanying persons \\nis eliminated. –  cents/km in all other cases of motor vehicle use and for the use of another \\nvehicle (for example, bicycle, e-bike). This rate is intended to cover the ongoing operating costs. \\nWith this new regulation, the formal procedure for “approval of one’s own vehicle for official \\ntravel” is eliminated, as is the previously often cumbersome examination of whether compelling \\nreasons exist. Furthermore, an incentive is created to use a bicycle or e-bike for shorter official \\ntrips. For the entitlement to mileage allowance, it is no longer required that the traveler uses a \\nvehicle they own.', 'Explanatory Memorandum B. Detailed Explanations Regarding § C For \\nparagraph : This corresponds to the previous § U LRKG.
